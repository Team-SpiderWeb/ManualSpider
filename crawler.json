That night when I was thinking about coming out, I was ready to lose my career, lose my fans. I was confident I would not lose my family because I knew that eventually they would understand me,\u201d she told Oprah Winfrey during a \"Where Are They Now\" episode broadcasted on the OWN network. ,She said that she felt like she was portraying a character for her mom and family for them to be happy, before she came out.  (READ: ,Charice speaks up on bullies, says she wants respect,),\"Before I came out, I was already a mess...when I was this person, you know, it felt like a character that I was portraying for my mom, for my family to be happy.

Manny Pacquiao needs knockouts to remind fans why they fell in love with him, and Jeff Horn may be just what the doctor ordered. Photo by Wendell Alinea/OSMP ,BRISBANE, Australia \u2013 \u201cSenator, you\u2019re being challenged by a schoolteacher. Aren\u2019t you nervous about getting educated in the ring?\u201d,The rehearsed question, thrown Pacquiao\u2019s way prior to Tuesday\u2019s media workout, drew laughter from the reporter gaggle, breaking up the monotony of brief answers that typify these gatherings. Pacquiao, who is as economical with his words as he is unselfish with his punches, rarely offers any insight into the aggression which rests behind his ever-present smile.,\u201cGood, he\u2019s a teacher. Also, I\u2019m a teacher in the ring,\u201d said Pacquiao, contrasting Jeff Horn\u2019s past occupation as a schoolteacher with the lessons he\u2019s handed to opponents in the ring over the past 22 years.,Pacquiao\u2019s often spoken of dismissively these days, like when unified welterweight titleholder Keith Thurman said the 38-year-old Pacquiao has \u201chad his hurrah\u201d and was \u201ckind of dying out\u201d as younger talent moved into the division.,Let\u2019s get some things straight: easily defeating two top 10 welterweights last year, including the much younger Jessie Vargas to win the title in his spare time while working as a senator is not to be minimized. Pacquiao showed last November that he was still quick, could attack from perplexing angles, and had enough pop to drop Vargas for the first time ever. ,He may be treated as an after-thought following the loss to Floyd Mayweather Jr, but Pacquiao is no one's stepping stone. He's still a handful for anyone in the division.,He\u2019s won 11 world titles in a record 8 divisions, and defeating the likes of Oscar de la Hoya, Miguel Cotto and Erik Morales, it\u2019s hard to live up to the standard he\u2019s set.,That\u2019s the quandary Pacquiao finds himself in ahead of his fight on Sunday, July 2, against Jeff Horn at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, Australia. The bar had once been set at fighting legends each time out, then it became a 10-year streak of fighting exclusively against fighters who were former or current world champions., ,Horn is the first opponent Pacquiao will have fought in 10 years that didn\u2019t fit that criteria, and the matchup was panned outside of Australia, though the fight being shown for free on ESPN in the United States has taken the edge off the criticism.,Prior to being floated by promoter Bob Arum as a potential opponent, Horn\u2019s was just a name you\u2019d see in the rankings and think \u201cwho the hell is that guy?\u201d Arum told the story Wednesday of how Horn\u2019s promoter Dean Lonergan, while negotiating with him for the WBO heavyweight title fight between Andy Ruiz Jr and Joseph Parker last year, told him to keep an eye on Horn., ,Horn was rated number two by the WBO at welterweight, and scored a technical knockout of Ali Funeka on the Ruiz-Parker card.,Horn earned his seat by bringing 50,000 fans and the backing of the Queensland government to the table. And it can\u2019t hurt the sport to pack a stadium in a town that doesn\u2019t often have big-time boxing.,The criticism surrounding this fight pretends that Muhammad Ali never gave the underwhelming Jean-Pierre Coopman a shot at the title, or unnecessarily rematched Joe Bugner when he needed a dance partner in Malaysia. Like an old rock band rebuilding from a hit album hangover, sometimes it takes going on the road to freshen the act up.,It\u2019s not as if Horn has nothing to lose (other than his unbeaten record), and Pacquiao has nothing to gain (other than $10 million). Pacquiao\u2019s pay-per-view buy rates have steadily dipped after the letdown of the Mayweather fight. And after 8 years without a knockout, Pacquiao\u2019s career is in desperate need of a facelift. Jeff Horn, with his relative inexperience coupled with an aggressive style, may be just what the doctor ordered.,Pacquiao beat a top 10 welterweight in his spare time from legislature duties last year, a fact not to be minimized. Photo by Wendell Alinea/OSMP ,Keeping the Horn fight off pay-per-view, and maximizing visibility by putting it on ESPN gives Pacquiao the chance to be seen in front of an audience of millions in primetime. Arum estimates that the fight \u2013 the first time Pacquiao has fought on basic cable in the United States \u2013 will attract a televised audience of 5 to 10 million in the United States, and set the lofty expectation that the fight will be the most watched boxing match in America since Ali defeated Leon Spinks in their 1978 rematch.,Pacquiao\u2019s conditioning coach Justin Fortune believes Horn is the perfect opponent to end his stoppage drought against, and Pacquiao\u2019s head trainer Freddie Roach said, he expected the fight to be \u201cshort and sweet.\u201d If Pacquiao can remind people of the carnage he once brought to the ring, he\u2019ll find himself back in demand.,\u201cThis is a real showcase fight for Pacquiao,\u201d said Arum.,\u201cIf he gets by this fight, maybe [junior welterweight champion] Terence Crawford would be a possibility, [IBF welterweight titleholder] Errol Spence would be a possibility.\u201d,\u201cThat\u2019s why Manny and I had spoken and it was Manny who insisted this fight in America be put on free TV,\u201d Pacquiao\u2019s advisor Michael Koncz said. \u201cBecause we need to build his credibility back up.\u201d,Will Pacquiao be back on pay-per-view again? It depends, said Arum. \u201cI think there is room for pay-per-view but it has to be used very judiciously. You can\u2019t expect people to pay money to see a fight just because it has a name or two involved,\u201d said Arum, who last had Pacquiao off-PPV in 2005 when he fought Hector Velazquez.,Arum told ESPN that fighting in America next wasn't likely, and that he's considering partnering with one of the emerging casinos in the Philippines to bring a Pacquiao fight to his home country, perhaps against unbeaten Russian Konstantin Ponomarev (32-0, 13 KOs). Koncz said he\u2019s spoken to Pacquiao about doing a fight in the Philippines, but that it\u2019d take the right deal to make it happen.,\u201cWe know people will turn out,\u201d Koncz told Rappler, adding, \u201cI need more than that. I need to have a substantial amount of money from some sponsors.\u201d,Koncz said Pacquiao will fight again in late October or November, and that, despite a deal falling through earlier this year to face Amir Khan in the United Arab Emirates, he wants to revisit Dubai as an option.,\u201cI\u2019m still looking at Dubai and I\u2019ve been there and I\u2019ll probably go there shortly after this fight,\u201d said Koncz. Arum, however, is hesitant about fighting in the Middle East for now, after, \"this whole nonsense started with Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\",Horn is younger, bigger and has a right hand that is best avoided. And if Pacquiao is able to do a number on him, he\u2019ll remind people of why they loved him in the first place.,\u201cI don\u2019t want to predict the fight, but we did a lot [in training],\u201d said Pacquiao with a smile. \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/174317-rumors-pacquiao-decline-greatly-exaggerated", "title": "Rumors of Pacquiao\u2019s decline greatly exaggerated"},

Taxpayers line up at the Quezon City Hall. File photo from QC Public Affairs and Information Services Office ,Are you supporting the comprehensive tax reform package proposed by the Department of Finance (DOF)? What are the salient points in the proposed bill? Is it really pro-poor?,Yes. As a tax advocate for more than 10 years, I am fully supporting the proposed comprehensive tax reform package. However, it does not mean I agree with all the provisions of the bill, such as the lifting of the bank secrecy law.,There are actually two versions: House Bill 4688 filed by Albay 2nd District Representative Joey Salceda last December 4, 2016, and House Bill 4774 filed by Quirino Representative Dakila Cua last January 17, 2017.,Here are the key components of the package:,1. Lowering personal income taxes,2. Broadening VAT base,3. Adjusting fuel excise taxes,4. Adjusting automobile excise taxes,5. Reducing donor's and estate tax rates to 6%,6. Lifting the bank secrecy law,7. Mandating establishments to issue electronic receipt or invoice,Both the Salceda and Cua bills target growth-driven poverty reduction by financing investments through the help of effective tax reform policies.,What do you think of the recent post of Marikina 2nd District Representative Miro Quimbo on his Facebook account? (\"One of the reasons for having a low tax effort is poor tax administration. Unless we improve tax administration first, new taxes will not be effective.\"),I fully agree with Representative Quimbo. In fact, based on my experience as a former Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) examiner, for every P1 collection from audit and investigation, the government is losing P10 to P100, depending on the size and income of the taxpayers. This means aside from the bribe money, the real leak comes from the government's inability to collect actual deficiency taxes from taxpayers who are not paying the right taxes because they figured they can bribe BIR examiners.,Unfortunately, tax policy reform will not address the tax leaks due to an inefficient and corrupt tax administration. However, we also cannot delay much-needed changes while waiting for both the BIR and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to improve its administration.,Overhauling our tax system will have to be simultaneously and continuously implemented through tax policy and administration reforms. It also means helping taxpayers in paying taxes correctly.,To reduce the tax leaks during the BIR audit and investigation, we proposed the Seal of Honesty (SOH) Certification Program to help taxpayers who have been regularly audited and compromised improve their voluntary payment without the threat of penalties and compromises. For details, email us at ,consult@acg.ph, or call (02) 6227720.,If you are to make recommendations to the DOF, what are the most crucial aspects of the proposal you want to change?,First, we have to give credit where credit is due. The DOF, together with the BIR and the BOC, have been working hard not just to improve our collections, but to reform our tax system as well.,Now, having expressed my full support and even joining the Tax Reform Roadshow organized by the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) with the DOF, I would like to appeal for the consideration of the following:,1. Implement a general tax amnesty (for all types of tax) before lifting the bank secrecy law. This will not just increase revenue collections, but also free those who wish to pay their taxes correctly from the burden of penalties and compromises. Also, unless the integrity of the BIR audit and investigation is ensured, lifting the bank secrecy law may only further empower \"corrupt\" BIR examiners who extort money from \"tax evaders.\",2. Remove the \"ultra-rich\" category as it will further discourage voluntary and honest declaration of income and taxes. Instead of targeting to collect more from the less than 1% of individual taxpayers by imposing 35% tax, we should aim to broaden our taxpayer base to involve those who are earning more than P5 million a year, but keep the highest rate at 25%. Also, consider keeping the Optional Standard Deduction (OSD) at 40% to encourage further voluntary payment with low compliance cost.,3. Support tax policy reform through tax administration reform. I think Representative Salceda had this in mind when he authored the Tax Administration Reform Act or TARA. Again, we need to make sure we collect the right taxes from a broader taxpayer base. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Got a question about taxes? #AskTheTaxWhiz!

Ressa", "date": "2016-09-05T08:22:53+0800", "content": "\nIn 2016, the Abu Sayyaf's senior ideological leader pledged allegiance to ISIS, and videos and statements about PH are spread by ISIS central propaganda groups    ,Rappler exclusive: Facebook screen shots April 21, 2016 ,Although the government declared a state of lawlessness, authorities have released little concrete information about the explosion that killed at least 14 people in Davao City\u2019s night market Friday, September 2, 2016.,On Saturday morning, September 3, ,radio station DZMM, said the Abu Sayyaf claimed responsibility for the blast in an interview with a self-proclaimed spokesman for Al Harakatul Al Islamiyah, the formal name used by the Abu Sayyaf.,By the afternoon, however, allegedly that same man, Muammar Askali, alias Abu Ramie, ,told the ,Inquirer, that it was carried out by an ally he called Daulat Ul Islamiya.,\u201cThey are doing this to sympathise (with) our group, and we are sending a message to President Rodrigo Duterte that all the Daulat throughout the country is not afraid of him,\u201d said Askali.,So who could be behind the explosion? To answer this question, let\u2019s look at the facts we know and provide some context. ,Islamic Community,First, the name Daulat Ul Islamiyah is a slight variation of Jemaah Islamiyah, which literally means \u201cIslamic Community.\u201d From the late 90s to 2005, Jemaah Islamiyah acted like al-Qaeda\u2019s arm in Southeast Asia, gaining global notoriety with the Bali bombings in 2002, which killed more than 200 people. ,The Abu Sayyaf was part of Jemaah Islamiyah and carried out a spate of bombings in the Philippines, including Southeast Asia\u2019s worst maritime terrorist attack in 2004. It was blacklisted as a terrorist organization by numerous countries, including the Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the US for bombings, kidnappings and beheadings. ,During its heyday, authorities said the Abu Sayyaf had up to 1,200 members which after more than a decade\u2019s presence of US troops, went down to as low as 240. Filipino officials say they estimate about 400 members today. ,President Rodrigo Duterte ordered this crackdown after the beheading of a Filipino too poor to pay ransom. That follows 2 high-profile beheadings of Canadians held for ransom. ,According to Rappler\u2019s sources, there are about 8,000 troops chasing the Abu Sayyaf today in Jolo, Sulu \u2013 or about 20 soldiers for every Abu Sayyaf member, but the ground war is never this easy in this complicated terrain.,Abu Sayyaf and ISIS,It\u2019s important to recognize that the most senior ideological leader of the Abu Sayyaf, Isnilon Hapilon, has ,pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State, or ISIS. At least 4 other groups in the Philippines have done the same and named Hapilon as their emir, one of the final steps for ISIS to declare a wilayat or province. (READ: ,Experts warn PH: Don\u2019t underestimate ISIS,),Initial intelligence reports confirmed Sunday by the police said the explosion was caused by an IED, an improvised explosive device made from a mortar round. ,The Sulu-based Abu Sayyaf tend to use ammonium nitrate for its explosives. A mortar round IED is closer to the signature bombs of two Abu Sayyaf allies who have pledged allegiance to ISIS: Ansar al-Khalifa, also known as AKP or Ansar Khalifa Philippines, based in southern Mindanao; and the Maute group in central Mindanao, also known as Daulah Islamiyah.,Both these groups evolved significantly since the time they worked with Jemaah Islamiyah. ,AKP and Indonesia,AKP is headed by Mohammad Jafar Maguid, more commonly known as Commander Tokboy, allegedly ,a former commander of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, (MILF) 105th Base Command. (READ: ,Two ISIS-allied militants killed in Philippines,),Tokboy was trained by key JI leaders, including Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, better known as Marwan, the high profile target of the Mamasapano tragedy that derailed the peace talks. (READ: ,Marwan\u2019s ties that bind: From family to global terrorism,),AKP under Tokboy has a direct link to Indonesian groups, especially MIT, Mujihidin Indonesia Timur, led by an Indonesian who trained in the Philippines, Santoso. ,Indonesian intelligence sources said they were investigating the flow of explosive materials from the Philippines to Indonesia after the January 14, 2016 Jakarta bombings.,In July, 2016, Indonesian forces ,killed Santoso,, dubbed the \u201csymbolic heart\u201d of the Indonesian jihadi movement. Some warned that his comrades may join the Abu Sayyaf. (READ: ,After death of Indonesia\u2019s top terrorist, comrades \u2018may join Abu Sayyaf\u2019,),AKP pledged allegiance to ISIS in a YouTube video in 2015, and is largely believed by experts to be one of the groups behind another video threatening the November, 2015 APEC Summit in Manila and later globally distributed by ISIS propaganda sites. (READ: ,ISIS\u2019 global ambitions and plans for Southeast Asia,),ISIS claims Maute jail break,The Maute group, which also calls itself Daulah Islamiyah, has carried out bombings and kidnappings. It carries the black flag and insignia of ISIS, and has been very active this year.,From February 20 to March 1, 2016, the group, which pledged allegiance to ISIS, attacked a military camp and established 3 major strongholds, essentially displacing nearly 30,000 people until ,troops regained control of the town of Butig, in Lanao del Sur. During that time, the group beheaded a soldier. It took 10 days for the military to regain control.,On April 21, 2016, a Facebook account posted two photos showing the Maute group beheading two of six sawmill workers kidnapped from Butig. They released four of the hostages six days after their kidnapping, but chose to behead the two because they were allegedly military informants.,The two beheaded were forced to wear orange jumpsuits, much like ISIS public executions. The post says, \u201cTwo spies beheaded by the Lions of IS ranao.\u201d ,Rappler exclusive: Facebook screen shots April 21, 2016 ,Finally, just last week on August 29, an ISIS propaganda arm, the Amaq news agency, claimed that ISIS was behind a prison raid at the Lanao del Sur jail in Marawi.,\u201cFighters from Islamic State stormed a prison in Marawi City in Philippines on Saturday, south of the country, and were able to free thirty prisoners and seizing weapons,\u201d wrote ,Amaq news agency,.,\u201cThirty fighters carried out the attack and were able to release 30 detainees, including fighters from the Islamic State and their wives. The fighters of the attack and all the detainees, who were freed, arrived to safe places without injuries,\u201d it stated.,Those arrested were caught with homemade mortars, which they told interrogators, were to be used in bombing missions in Iligan and Cagayan de Oro.,In its report, the BBC said no shots were fired during the prison break, and that a military source said ,\u201cthe men had been allowed to escape.\u201d,A military report obtained by Rappler states, \u201crecruits of the Maute group were largely drawn from the MILF ranks, particularly disgruntled factions prompted by the failures in the Bangsamoro Basic Law or close associates and blood relatives.\u201d ,Evolving landscape,These are only some of the possible groups behind the Davao bombing. ,What happened to the terrorist networks in the Philippines is exactly what happened to al-Qaeda globally: authorities gouged out their top and middle rank leadership, but the ideology and cells continued to burrow and evolve. ,Jemaah Islamiyah was an umbrella group that hijacked homegrown networks. Although the MILF ,turned away from global terrorism in 2005,, other groups like the Abu Sayyaf, the Rajah Solaiman Movement, continued to push a terrorist agenda.  ,There are still other groups like the al-Khobar, another MILF extremist splinter group that turned to criminal activities like bus bombings in 2011. (Read: ,Philippines\u2019 evolving terrorism threat,) ,What has happened to them today? ,A clear evolution is the clarion call of the Islamic State, which has its own Southeast Asian battallion in Syria called Khatibah Nusantara. (READ: ,ISIS and Jakarta attacks: What we need to know,),Part of the problem is that the strategy of the Aquino administration largely centered on denial. This is despite the June, 2016 call of a Malaysian jihadist in Syria, Mohd Rafi Udin, for ISIS followers to go to the Philippines, making it \"the nucleus\" in Southeast Asia. (READ: ,ISIS to followers in SEAsia: 'Go to the Philippines,'),This month, President Rodrigo Duterte became the first Filipino official to publicly acknowledge the threat of ISIS.

Rappler file photo ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Both the government and rebel group Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) committed ceasefire violations during the deadly clash in Mamasapano, Maguindanao, that killed 67 Filipinos. ,This is according to the \"verification report\" produced by the Malaysian-led International Monitoring Team (IMT), the independent body overseeing the ceasefire agreement between the MILF and the government.,The Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP) released a summary of the findings Monday, April 6. ,Like what the ,police Board of Inquiry (BOI) report, pointed out, ,the IMT report underscored that the ceasefire agreement was not observed during the planning and execution of Oplan Exodus. ,While the Senate report on Mamasapano tagged the incident as a ,massacre,, the IMT report described the clash as an incident that went from \"the status of deliberately uncoordinated movements to a disastrous firefight\" between the 55th Special Action Company (SAC) of the police Special Action Force (SAF) and the 105th base command of the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF), the armed wing of the MILF. ,The 55th SAC served as the blocking force for the 84th SAC that was tasked to neutralize wanted terrorists Zulkifli bin Hir (Marwan) and Abdul Basit Usman. Marwan was killed but Usman was able to get away. (READ: ,Mamasapano: Time on target,),They encountered members of the MILF who were on the move following the initial gunfight between the 84th SAC and alleged members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF). ,On alleged terror links ,Contrary to claims made by ,Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, that the MILF was protecting Marwan, the IMT report said there was no evidence to show that the MILF as an organization provided sanctuary to criminals and lawless elements. ,However, the IMT noted some members of the MILF might have had knowledge of the whereabouts of Marwan and Usman. Mamasapano \u2013 the site of the encounter \u2013 is a known bailiwick of the MILF. ,First shot,The IMT said \"there is probable cause to assume,\" based on evidence gathered from bullet marks at the bridge in Barangay Tukanalipao, that it was members of the 55th SAC who opened fire during the clash, killing two MILF combatants. ,This indicates a \"full firefight rather than a mere uncoordinated movement,\" according to the report. ,It was not a violation of the ceasefire agreement on the part of the MILF when it fought back as the move can be seen as a response to the police operation that was not coordinated with them. ,But the IMT said the BIAF's entry into the cornfields where the 55th SAC was located can be considered as aggressive action, violating ceasefire protocols. In order to reach the cornfield, the BIAF had to cross the river or the bridge in Barangay Tukanalipao. ,The police has accused the MILF of carrying out summary executions of the SAF commandos after ,medico-legal reports, showed that some members of the 55th SAC were shot dead at close range. The ,MILF,, in its own report, meanwhile, denied the allegation and pointed to the presence of other armed groups in the area, including the breakaway Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters. ,There is no sufficient evidence that the MILF committed the summary executions against the SAF due to the lack of witnesses, according to the IMT report. ,Meanwhile, the IMT said the government side committed another ceasefire violation over the killing of 4 sleeping MILF fighters by ,SAF survivor Christopher Lalan,.,Firearms, personal effects,In the aftermath of the clash, the ,MILF returned 16 SAF weapons, as a sign that it remains committed to the peace process. ,According to the IMT, the items taken by the MILF BIAF from falled SAF combatants are considered military and not personal items. These include cellphones that were being used as communication tools or as military items during the fight. ,The IMT report only seeks to \"verify\" the reports submitted by the respective ceasefire committees of the MILF and the government, provide recommendations, and not make thorough investigations, said chief government peace negotiator Miriam Coronel Ferrer.,It is not part of the IMT's mandate to recommend legal sanctions \u2013 a task that is best left to the Department of Justice, Ferrer said. ,Read the summary of the report provided by the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process below: , \u2013 ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/89080-international-monitoring-team-report-mamasapano", "title": "Int'l Monitoring Team: Mamasapano a 'disastrous firefight'"},

File photo of suspended PNP chief Director General Alan Purisima,MANILA, Philippines - It was the suspended chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP) who was on top of the operation to arrest top terrorists in Mamasapano, Maguindanao, that ended up killing 44 members of the police Special Action Force (SAF).,This was confirmed by Director Getutlio Nape\u00f1as Jr, the SAF commander during the bloody January 25 operation who was sacked after allegations he did not give the PNP hierarchy sufficient information on the plan.,\u201c,Inapprove ni General Purisima,,\u201d Nape\u00f1as said, referring to suspended PNP chief Director General Alan Purisima who is facing graft charges before the Ombudsman.,A friend and former aide of President Benigno Aquino III, ,Purisima was suspended, on December 4, 2014 as a result of those charges. The President has not named any replacement and instead chose to appoint Deputy Director General Leonardo Espina as Acting PNP chief.

Sinabihan niya ako na magcoordinate sa intelligence group para magsagawa, magplano, makuha ang intelligence packet para sa paglunsad ng operation. Nakuha ng aking isang official ang packet at nagsimula na ng pagpaplano,.\",Marwan carried a $5-million bounty for his arrest based on the US Federal Bureau of Investigation list. The Philippine government put up its own reward of P7.4 million for his arrest.,SAF launched the first operation in November 2014 under Oplan Terminator, according to Nape\u00f1as. The plan was \u201caborted\u201d because the banca that the police used for the operation broke down, he said.,They tried again on December 12, 2014, Nape\u00f1as said, confirming an earlier ,Rappler report, about a botched December operation. ,He explained that the December operation was compromised when they engaged in a brief firefight with Moro rebels in the area. \u201c,Gumamit kami ng boats galing sa Zamboanga. On their way papasok sa target, nagkaroon ng engagement sa river. Na force na hindi ituloy ang mission,,\u201d Nape\u00f1as said.,All this time, Purisima supervised the operation, he said. ,This was Nape\u00f1as's way of explaining why Purisima, even if already suspended by January 25, remained on top of the plan. \",Nabanggit ko kanina na sa kanilang 2 nag-rereport [Purisima and Acting PNP chief Deputy Director General Leonardo Espina) ako sa kadahilanan na yung project na 'yun inumpisahan pa ni General Purisima noong April pa November tuloy tuloy at siya ang may hawak ng intelligence,,\" Nape\u00f1as said.,Yet, the ex-SAF commander admitted he only informed Espina about the January 25 operation after the troopers had entered Mamasapano \u2013 also upon the specific instructions of Purisima. \",Sinabihan ako mismo ni Director General Purisima na sabihan mo si General Espina pag nandoon na,,\" he said. ,Plan began April,Espina and Interior Secretary Mar Roxas earlier said they were kept ,out of the loop, in the January 25 plan.,Nape\u00f1as was adamant that the PNP hierarchy, as well as President Aquino and Roxas, knew of the plan to arrest the two terrorists.,But Nape\u00f1as was referring to an April 2014 command briefing for the top echelon \u2013 or 9 months before the January 25 attack and one month after the Aquino administration signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).,\u201c,Yung April na nabanggit ko kanina, nagkaroon ng presentation doon sa command conference sa Camp Crame. Nandoon ang ating mahal na Pangulo, SILG, PNP Purisima, Gen delos Reyes at ako, at immediately pagkatapos ng presentation ng Oplan Wolverin, present ko rin may Police Deputy Director General Espina sa kanyang office,.\u201d Chief Superintendent Noel De Los Reyes was then regional police of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. ,Nape\u00f1as did not say whether Aquino or Roxas approved the plan, although the President himself said he was privy to the operation and was ,in touch directly with Nape\u00f1as,. ,The long-running intelligence operation also had 3 Oplans (operation plans): Oplan Wolverin (April 2014), Oplan Terminator (November 2014) and Oplan Exodus (January 2015). This explains confusing statements from SAF officials who were referring to the January 25 plan either as Oplan Wolverin or Oplan Exodus.,Nape\u00f1as said he's sure that they got Marwan, threatening to quit if they killed the wrong man. (READ: ,Marwan and the ties that bind,),The incident however has put Aquino in a corner, as he's being criticized for not taking responsibility for it and not showing up at a military airbase when the bodies of the slain cops arrived in Manila. ,It also further proves the influence of Purisima with the President. The general is sitting out a 6-month suspension, which ends in June this year. By then he would only have 5 months to serve before his scheduled retirement in November.,The clash has also jeopardized the peace agreement that his government has signed with the MILF, which lost at least 17 members that day.

A commercial boom in the popular tourism destination is threatening the city's water supply. Photo from Drumlanrig from Wikimedia Commons,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Environmentalists and concerned citizens of Cavite filed a petition for Writ of Kalikasan on Wednesday, June 18, to scrap a project that threatens the province's water supply. ,The Save Water in Indang Movement (SWIM) accuses PTK2 H2O Corporation of building a dam and water delivery pipes aimed at extracting more water than is sustainable from 3 major watersheds in Cavite. (READ: ,Bulacan deforestation 'drying up' Metro Manila water supply,),The project is for PTK2 H2O to fulfill a contract it signed with the Tagaytay City Water District (TCWD) in 2012. A government-owned and controlled corporation, the TCWD contracted the company to supply 50,000 cubic meters of water a day to be delivered to Tagaytay City's commercial establishments, hotels, and real estate projects. ,This amount of water, however, is more than the 3 watersheds can supply if they are also to provide water for the 12 other local government units surrounding them.  ,The project \"allows the extraction of water ultimately for commercial and industrial use in the single City of Tagaytay to the prejudice of domestic and municipal appropriation for 12 cities and municipalities of Cavite Province in violation of the Water Code,\" reads the petition. ,The 50,000 cubic meters a day is 77.1% of the total amount of water discharged by the 4 major rivers that spring from the watersheds \u2013 64,885.6 cubic meters a day.,According to Noel Sedigo, environmental scientist and chairman of the forestry department of Cavite State University (CSU), \"the rule of thumb is that no more than 30% of a river's average flow can be taken out each year without risking a shortfall in supply every 20 years.\",Respondents in the petition include the TCWD for entering into the contract, the National Water and Resources Board (NWRB) for granting PTK2 H2O the water rights to extract that volume of water, and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Region IV for issuing an Environmental Compliance Certificate without the required documents. ,'Environmentally critical project',The TCWD entered into a contract with PTK2 H2O in April 2012 because it recognized that the current water supply of Tagaytay City would not be enough to sustain the many commercial establishments and hotels currently being built there. ,Tagaytay City is one of the most popular tourism destinations in Luzon because of its cool climate and view of Taal Lake. Recent years have seen condominiums, restaurants, hotels, and even theme parks sprout all over the city.,\"During the summer season, long holidays and weekends, water demand is expected to increase tremendously, even as high as double the normal demand, and upon completion and full operation of all the ongoing establishments and hotels currently being built,\" reads the water supply contract.,Because of the city's \"dire need of additional water resources,\" the NWRB granted PTK2 H2O the rights to source water from the 4 rivers generated by the watersheds and which flow from the town of Indang, namely the Ikloy, Indang, Lambak, and Saluysoy rivers. ,At first, the contract was for 10,000 cubic meters a day or 3.6 million cubic meters a year. But a new contract, signed in July that year, was for the company to increase the volume to 50,000 cubic meters a day or 18.25 million cubic meters a year.,However, a study by the CSU in Indang shows that the 4 rivers are capable of delivering only 36,400 cubic meters a day. The study was commissioned to assess Cavite's bulk water supply. ,\"Practically the entire province of Cavite is sacrificed to benefit real estate moguls who seek to rake in billions in profits from their Tagaytay investments,\" decried SWIM legal counsel Renecio Espiritu. ,Citing the study that he conducted for CSU \u2013 the result of 20 years worth of research on Cavite's ground and surface water system \u2013 Sedigo concludes in his affidavit that PTK2 H2O's project is an \"environmentally critical project\" with \"severely adverse and dangerous effects to the environment.\" ,No proper environmental assessment,SWIM also criticized DENR Region IV-A for issuing an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) without the required Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that would comprehensively assess the possible environmental hazards the project would cause. ,PTK2 H2O also only secured the ECC after the water permits were issued.,\"In other words, the ECC is incomplete and issued as an afterthought. Under the law, the ECC and the requisite EIS are conditions prior to and not after the issuance of permits,\" reads the petition. ,The ECC allows the company to build an intake structure, booster pumps, flocculation and sedimentation basin, pressure filter tanks, effluent channels, booster pumping stations, water pipes, and administration buildings in the village of Kayquit II in Indang. PTK2 H2O has already begun construction on pavements and pumping stations.,The project also led to the cutting down of trees, some of which were native molave species, which also allegedly lacked an ECC.  ,The legal office of DENR Region IV-A told Rappler they cannot comment on the case because they have not yet received a copy of the petition.,\"We will hold a technical conference hearing about the project on July 3. We will invite the complainant and other concerned stakeholders,\" said Faina Ifurung of the legal office.,Despite repeated attempts to call the PTK2 H2O office, Rappler was met by a busy phone line.  ,NWRB Executive Director Sevillo David Jr also said they cannot comment on the issue since they have yet to receive a copy of the petition. ,However, he told Rappler that the permit issued to PTK2 H2O does not require an ECC beforehand based on the Water Code. ,\"Based on our procedures, an ECC is not required for issuance of a water permit. We have applications that require an ECC but in this case, since it is bulk water, an ECC is not required,\" he said. ,Questioned on the alleged unsustainable amount of water his office allows PTK2 H2O to extract, Sevilla said, \"We have to check on that because part of our technical assessment is to look at the availability of the supply of water.

In her spare times, she likes to analyze a popular boyband\u2019s sexist song lyrics.,Though we haven\u2019t known each other for a long time, and only through social media, we share some common interests, and I consider Abbie a very good partner for just any kind of discussion.,One day, Abbie was raped.,She told me her story while we chatted online. She said she knew that I\u2019m a medical doctor with interests in gender and sexuality issues, and that was why she revealed her story to tell me.,\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure if it was a rape and a sexual violence,\u201d she told me.  \u201cWould you give me your perspective?\u201d,Getaway,It began when she was chatting with a male friend \u2013 let\u2019s call him Tom. She and Tom had been friends for some time. They hung out together, told stories, jokes, and secrets.,\u201cWe\u2019re good buddies. We never judge each other,\u201d she described her relationship with him. Tom had a \u201cbad boy\u201d reputation, which was what made Abbie have a little crush on him. Nothing romantic ever happened, though.,Abbie and Tom hadn\u2019t met for a while because he worked in another city. That day, Tom offered Abbie to go on a little vacation in his city. A short getaway \u2013 something that Abbie kind of needed at the time, as she was going through some problems of late. So she agreed and flew there a few days later.,In the city, while Tom was working, he\u2019d asked one of his friend to accompany Abbie going around the city. Such a caring friend he was, Abbie thought. What a perfect getaway.,One night, the 3 of them hung out in a bar. It was a typical night out; beers, jokes, some good laughs. Abbie was never a heavy drinker, nor was she used to clubbing. She drank beer or tasted wine occasionally and that was it. But that night, Tom and his friend offered her a local ,arak,, which tasted good, but she did not realized how high its alcohol concentration was. She had never been that drunk before in her life.,After a while, they decided to go home. Abbie remembered Tom asking her, \u201cSo, do I go back to my rented room, or do I go to your hotel?\u201d,She didn\u2019t remember her answer. Maybe \u201cup to you?\u201d \u2013  hell, she didn\u2019t know for sure. Tom\u2019s friend took her back to the hotel. She didn\u2019t know how Tom went back, but he had asked her to wait for him in the lobby.,Black out,Long story short, they met in the lobby and went to her room. When they went in, she nearly blacked out. Her memory of the event was blurry. She remembered Tom, moving on top of her, asking her to stay still or holding her down so she wouldn\u2019t move.,She woke up only when she felt the pain. And the blood. Blood everywhere. When she went to the bathroom to clean herself blood trickled down her thighs. There was blood on the bedsheet, on the bed cover, on the carpet, in the bathtub.,\u201cIt looked like a murder on TV series,\u201d Abbie told me.,She sat inside the bathtub so as not to make any more mess with the blood. Tom went out to get some disposable menstrual pads. When he got back and told Abbie that they had to go to the doctor, she was nearly unconscious.,That night, Abbie was admitted to an medical emergency facility. She lost so much blood that her hemoglobin concentration was already half the normal value. Then came the operation, the blood transfusion. When we chatted, she just came back from a visit to check on the stitches. Her vaginal wall was torn almost 6cm wide.,Abbie asked me, \u201cCould a penis penetration be that rough, or was it just because I didn\u2019t have enough foreplay?\u201d,She had never had sex before.,Victim,To be honest, I was confused, too. I\u2019ve heard about rape cases so violent that the victim\u2019s vagina was torn, but I\u2019ve never seen one myself. I\u2019ve had a case of vaginal tearing once, but it was from childbearing and the patient lost even less blood than Abbie.,Even more a mystery to her was the event that led to the penetration: \u201cI\u2019m still confused about my consent to him. I even told him that I was sorry, repeatedly.\u201d,Abbie\u2019s family will not file a lawsuit and neither will she.,\u201cI\u2019m not going to make it the second Sitok\u2019s case,\u201d she said, referring to an alleged rape case by a prominent Indonesian poet.,The one condition that makes her unsure about her legal probabilities is that she was drunk.,She has started to imagine all kinds of things people will say \u2013 \u201cBut who told her to get drunk?\u201d, \u201cWho told her to go out that night, a woman with two men?\u201d, \u201cWho told her, a virgin, to have a male inside her hotel room?\u201d and so on. And that is only from common people. I can imagine how she would feel when law enforcers asked this kind of questions during their investigation too, if the media ran her story.,So they chose to settle the issue peacefully. During a heated argument between Abbie, her mother, her then boyfriend and Tom, her boyfriend confronted Tom.,The latter defended himself, \u201cBut I was just a victim of Abbie\u2019s problems.\u201d,A victim. Him. Not Abbie.,Rape,Tom has promised to \u201cshare\u201d responsibilities. He promised to pay for half of the medical bills. But he has since done nothing of sort. He even blocked all kinds of direct communication with Abbie, including on social media, and is only willing to be contacted through a mutual friend of theirs.,And that was Abbie\u2019s story. I have asked for her permission to be her voice, because, though she has a plan to tell it herself later, currently she\u2019s not quite ready.,For me, it is clear that she was raped violently. The definition of rape is \u201csex without consent\u201d, period. Abbie was clearly not able to give consent at the time of her assault, much less fight her perpetrator.,Her story is a scary story. But for me, the scariest thing about it is that here, in the 21,st, century, a smart and educated woman still thinks it was her fault that she was raped. Here, supposedly long after the dark ages, a victim is still confused if what happened to her was a rape or not.,That shows us how deeply rooted patriarchy is inside our head and how patriarchy can make the actual victims blame themselves for their sufferings and how patriarchy likes to throw rocks on its victim\u2019s head, then bury the victim under those rocks. ,It reminds us how evil patriarchy is, and how much we need to fight it. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,This article was first published on ,Magdalene,.

{"author": "Spring Chenoa Cooper and Anthony Santella", "date": "2016-01-06T03:19:02+0800", "content": "\nIn actual fact, masturbation has many health benefits    , ,Conduct an Internet search for \u201cmasturbation,\u201d and you will find hundreds, if not thousands, of slang phrases for the act.,This proliferation of slang phrases suggests people want to talk about masturbation, but are uncomfortable about doing so directly. Using comedic terms provides a more socially acceptable way to express themselves.,So before we talk any more about it, let\u2019s normalize it a bit. Masturbation, or touching one\u2019s own genitals for pleasure, is something that babies do from the time they are in the womb. It\u2019s a natural and normal part of healthy sexual development.,According to a ,nationally representative US sample,, 94% of men admit to masturbating, as do 85% of women. But societal perspectives of masturbation still vary greatly, and there\u2019s even some stigma around engaging in the act.,Related to this stigma are the many myths about masturbation, myths so ridiculous it\u2019s a wonder anyone believes them.,They include: masturbation causes blindness and insanity; masturbation can make sexual organs fall off; and masturbation causes infertility.,In actual fact, masturbation has many health benefits.,Good for you,For women, masturbation can help prevent cervical infections and urinary tract infections through the process of \u201ctenting,\u201d or the opening of the cervix that occurs as part of the arousal process.,Tenting stretches the cervix, and thus the cervical mucous. This enables fluid circulation, allowing cervical fluids full of bacteria to be flushed out.,Masturbation can lower risk of type-2 diabetes (though this association may also be explained by greater overall health), reduce insomnia through hormonal and tension release, and increase pelvic floor strength through the contractions that happen during orgasm.,For men, masturbation helps reduce risk of ,prostate cancer,, probably by giving the prostate a chance to flush out potential cancer-causing agents.,Masturbation also improves ,immune, functioning by increasing cortisol levels, which can regulate immune functioning in small doses. It also reduces ,depression, by increasing the amount of endorphins in the bloodstream.,Masturbation can also indirectly prevent infertility by ,protecting people, from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can lead to infertility \u2013 you can\u2019t give yourself one of these infections!,There is one final benefit to masturbation: it\u2019s the most convenient method for maximising orgasms.,And there are plenty of additional benefits from orgasms generally, ,including, reduced stress, reduced blood pressure, increased self-esteem, and reduced pain.,Good for your partner too,From a sexual health point of view, masturbation is one of the safest sexual behaviors. There\u2019s no risk of pregnancy or transmission of sexually transmitted infections; there\u2019s no risk of disappointing a partner or of performance anxiety; and there\u2019s no emotional baggage.,And, only an arm\u2019s length away, is mutual masturbation. Mutual masturbation (two partners who are pleasuring themselves in the company of the other) is a great (and safe) activity to incorporate into other partnered sexual activities.,It can be especially good to begin to learn more about what your partner likes and to demonstrate to your partner what you like. Open communication with a partner will improve your sex life and relationship, but is also important for modeling communication skills for younger generations.,Talking about masturbation also has benefits. Promoting ,sex-positive views, in our own homes and in society, including around masturbation, allows us to teach young people healthy behaviors and attitudes without stigma and shame.,Parents and guardians who feel embarrassed or need extra guidance to do this should seek out sex-positive sources of information, like ,ones from respected universities,. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,This article first appeared on ,The Conversation,.,Spring Chenoa Cooper, is a Senior Lecturer, University of Sydney; ,Anthony Santella, is ,Lecturer of HIV, STIs and Sexual Health, University of Sydney.", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/bahasa/englishedition/118095-masturbation-health-benefits", "title": "Happy news!

Erich was also blooming on the red carpet, all smiles and loving looks exchanged with Daniel.,Bea Alonzo in Alexander McQueen, ,Last year, Bea went with two Great Gatsby-inspired looks, and this year, she changed it up in simple black and white.

This past UAAP Finals saw the collegiate careers of Kim Fajardo and Jia Morado come to a close. File photos   , ,MANILA, Philippines - Exactly a week has passed since the De La Salle University Lady Spikers swept the Ateneo Lady Eagles to retain the Women\u2019s Volleyball title in Season 79., ,It has also been a week since the league\u2019s two star setters, Kim Fajardo and Jia Morado, whispered their final farewell to the UAAP stage in two completely different manners., ,While Fajardo rightfully and joyously celebrated the Lady Spikers\u2019 two-peat, Morado opted for a tranquil, graceful exit from the collegiate ranks.,A legacy in La Salle, ,Saturday, May 6 was an eventful day for Fajardo, to say the least. Right before Game 2 of the Finals series against Ateneo, the 5,th, year playmaker received two plums as the regular season\u2019s Best Setter and Best Server.,On the way to the Big Dome, head coach Ramil de Jesus cautioned the Lady Spikers to remain focused on the task at hand even after the individual recognition rites. With Fajardo leading the way, the Taft-based squad managed to pull through and stopped the Lady Eagles from forcing a championship rubber match.,\u201cSabi ko sa kanila, atin \u2018to. Walang bibitaw,\u201d said the DLSU team captain. \u201cSobrang sarap, hindi ko alam kung paano ie-express. Sobrang saya ko talaga.\u201d, ,(I told them to hold on, that this is ours. It\u2019s a really pleasant feeling, I don\u2019t know how else to express it. I\u2019m just really happy.), ,The Batangas native added that while she felt happy upon hearing that the team wanted to dedicate this title for her, she also wanted the sweet victory to inspire the younger Lady Spikers for the years to come., ,\u201cGusto ko sila maglaro para sa kanila, gusto ko sila magkaroon din ng name for them,\u201d shared Fajardo. \u201c[Pero] sabi ko,kung makakalaro sila nang maayos, at dine-dedicate nila sa kin \u2018yun, why not?\u201d, ,(I wanted the team to play for themselves, to have their own names established. [But then] I told myself, if they play well and they wanted to dedicate the win for me, why not?) (READ: ,Welcome to Kim Fajardo\u2019s last dance,),Fairytale ending,After snatching the volleyball crown back in Season 78, the skipper was all but decided on whether she\u2019ll utilize her final playing year for La Salle., ,Now that everything is said and done, Fajardo, who tallied 6 markers along with 43 excellent sets in her last dance, couldn\u2019t help but look back at the memories - both good and bad - she has made with her teammates and coaching staff during her time in Taft., ,\u201cPinapagalitan niya [Coach Ramil] ako parati eh,\u201d Fajardo shared with a laugh. \u201cMamimiss ko sila talaga. Hindi nakikita sa TV kung papaano sila sa labas ng court. Mamimiss ko talaga \u2018yun.\u201d,([Coach Ramil] always scolds me. I will really miss them. People don\u2019t see on TV how we are as a team outside the court. I will really miss them.), ,Like a perfectly sculpted storybook ending, Fajardo steps away from the collegiate stage with no regrets and some of the best decisions of her life and career.,\u201cSiyempre naman po, worth it lahat ng nangyari sa akin, (everything was all worth it).\u201d, ,Ace in Katipunan, ,The narrative wasn\u2019t woven the same way, however, for Ateneo\u2019s captain and ace setter Morado. The 22-year old kept mum back in the locker room, but shocked everyone when she divulged the ,decision to forego her final eligibility year ,during her community speech in the Church of the Gesu at Ateneo.,Before her, the Blue Eagle crowd remained consistent with \u201cOne More Year\u201d chants, hoping that their star playmaker, like Fajardo, would decide to suit up for a 5,th, straight year., ,Little did they know that what would come after would break the hearts not only of the Lady Eagles, but also of numerous volleyball fans around the country., ,But just like in other aspects of life, one has to eventually move on., ,\u201cIt was an honor to play for the Blue and White,\u201d a tearful Morado declared during her speech., ,\u201cAs much as it hurts to say, I\u2019d like to move on, and I\u2019m looking forward to a new chapter in my life. I know it won\u2019t be easy to understand why.\u201d,Her quiet yet riveting departure and refusal to steal the limelight during the championship game say a lot about the former Best Setter\u2019s character. But Morado, in her own simple way, has definitely stamped a personal mark in both Ateneo and Philippine volleyball., ,The setters\u2019 exit,Longtime La Salle mentor De Jesus meanwhile believes that no matter how hard they try, the Lady Spikers won\u2019t be able to find nor replace a legend that is Kim Fajardo., ,\u201cPaano papalitan \u2018yung Kim Fajardo? Mahirap \u2018yun, iisa lang \u2018yun eh. Nag-iisa lang ang Kim Fajardo.\u201d, ,(How do you replace Kim Fajardo? You can\u2019t, because there\u2019s only one Kim Fajardo.),The league won\u2019t likely find another Kim Fajardo or Jia Morado soon. The two may have already put an end to their respective UAAP chapters, but this surely isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ll see of them., ,\uff0d,Rappler.com ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/169708-setters-exit-fajardo-morado", "title": "Setters\u2019 exit: Bidding farewell to Kim Fajardo and Jia Morado"},

He also created and set off a bomb outside the Philippine ambassador\u2019s house in Jakarta, Indonesia, 4 months earlier., ,After Al-Ghozi was arrested in January 2002, he told the Philippine police about his hideout in General Santos City. When they raided it, they found 1.2 tons of explosives slated for ,al-Qaeda\u2019s ambitious suicide truck-bombing plots, in Singapore targeting Western embassies and interests. It was supposed to be carried out by JI members working with al-Qaeda suicide bombers and ,needed 21 tons of explosives,.,In 2002, authorities around the world working to prevent ongoing plots didn\u2019t know the role Marwan played in these networks. Now, looking back, we can piece together the ties that bind him and his family to local and global terror plots. ,In that hideout, along with the explosives, the Philippine police found an identity card with the picture of Marwan, a Malaysian terrorist whose real name is Zulkifli bin Hir. It was the first time authorities in the Philippines would see the man whose ,death in a special forces operation, 13 years later would cost the lives of 44 police special operatives. ,The information comes from interviews and classified documents obtained over more than a decade of research from nearly half a dozen nations and verified by at least two independent sources.,US-educated,From al-Ghozi\u2019s hideout, Philippine police filed away that Indonesian identity card of Hendri Lawi from Makassar, Indonesia. This is the first time it's being released publicly. The card had a picture of a half-smiling Marwan looking like a businessman in his suit. , ,It\u2019s an identity he knows. After all, Marwan is US-educated, with an electrical engineering degree from Arizona State University. Yet from 1991-1994, he trained with the mujahideen in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in training camps that became crucibles of terror.,Marwan\u2019s brother, ,Rahmat Abdhir,, arrested in the United States in 2007, told the FBI a year later that Filipinos who trained with Marwan in Afghanistan helped him flee to the Philippines in 2001 to escape arrest in Malaysia. Marwan was wanted by Malaysian authorities for his role in the assassination of a lawmaker and a bank robbery carried out by a group he led, the Kumpulan Mujahideen Malaysia, an affiliate group under the umbrella of Jemaah Islamiyah. JI itself was seen then as al-Qaeda\u2019s arm in Southeast Asia.,At the time, Marwan was training members of the MILF and working closely with al-Ghozi to source, the 21 tons of ammonium nitrate ,needed for their plots, not just in the Philippines, but also in Malaysia. ,Rahmat said Marwan was working with ,Yazid Sufaat, a Malaysian who experimented with biological weapons for al-Qaeda, and who ,hosted some of the 9/11 hijackers in his apartment in Kuala Lumpur,, Malaysia\u2019s capital. Sufaat used a company he owned to purchase 4 tons of ammonium nitrate, which Marwan arranged to hide in a palm oil plantation near Muar, Malaysia. ,Marwan's wives,That plantation was owned by Marwan\u2019s uncle. When the 4 tons of ammonium nitrate was discovered, Marwan's cousin, ,Mohamad Amin Musa,, was jailed by Malaysian authorities.,Marwan comes from a family of jihadists: in 2001, his youngest brother was arrested for the Atrium bombing plot in Indonesia; in 2003, his cousin, whom authorities suspected of recruiting young Malaysians for training in the Philippines, was arrested in Malaysia; and, in 2007, his brother, Rahmat, was arrested in the United States.,Here\u2019s another example of the ties that bind: Rahmat\u2019s roommate in San Jose, California, is the brother of Marwan\u2019s first Malaysian wife, Maria Halim. She and Marwan have at least one daughter.  ,Rahmat was arrested by US authorities for funneling money and resources to Marwan in the Philippines. Rahmat transferred money to the Philippines by using the bank accounts of Marwan\u2019s second wife, Filipina Pahmiyah Sabil. She married Marwan sometime in the 3rd quarter of 2003, and as of 2006, they had a daughter and a son. Part of the money transferred by Rahmat came from the brother of Marwan\u2019s first wife.  ,Pahmiyah is the daughter of Mohammad Sabil, the barangay chairman of Talitay, Pikit, North Cotabato. Their extended family includes members of the MILF. The family had enough local and political clout that when Marwan repeatedly got sick with acute kidney disorder and hypertension in 2006, they were able to get him a doctor who treated him at an MILF camp, and when that didn\u2019t work, they rented a boat and an L-300 van to bring him for treatment to a health center, where Pahmiyah\u2019s cousin worked. ,Marwan liked the Philippines and Filipino women, marrying at least two more in succeeding years. At one point, Pahmiyah complained and confronted Marwan, who \u201cis fond of looking for a text mate on his cellular phone, particularly women.\u201d ,From 2003 to 2006, Marwan moved at least 8 times, moving around Cotabato City, Maguindanao, and North Cotabato. In 2005, he and Pahmiyah lived in Mamasapano, where he would eventually be killed by special police operatives in January 2015. , ,MILF links,Through most of his time in the Philippines, Marwan found shelter with armed groups: the MILF in central Mindanao, and the Abu Sayyaf in Jolo, where he lived from 2010 to 2012. ,In the early years, it seemed part of the reason he was in Pikit was to be near the MILF leadership. In 2005, when the central leadership kicked out the Abu Sayyaf, Rajah Solaiman Movement, and Jemaah Islamiyah, Marwan moved into a house in Kabuntulan, Maguindanao.  ,In March 2006, Marwan and his family moved into the operational base of then MILF commander Esmael Solaiman, also known as Abu Hashim, in Pikit, North Cotabato. Abu Hashim is an Afghan-trained confidant of former MILF chairman Hashim Salamat. Marwan was also welcomed at different times in the 105th and the 108th base command of the MILF. In exchange, Marwan would train MILF members.  , ,\u201cOur situation is similar to the United States in Afghanistan,\u201d MILF chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal told me in 2011. \u201cThe Americans and Osama bin Laden, they were friends. They were siding with each other when the Russians were invading Afghanistan. They were even sharing the same troops, see? In other words, sometimes you cannot choose your friends.\u201d,For years, the MILF kept the JI card, its special operations group, and links to the Abu Sayyaf as options \u2013 but far enough away for plausible deniability. Iqbal hinted that revolutionary groups and guerrilla armies around the world use tactics like this to level the playing field against larger and better-armed forces of government. The problem, of course, is that it tainted the MILF\u2019s own revolutionary cause.,So the MILF central leadership evolved: from turning a blind eye early on, to kicking out terrorists who might endanger the peace talks in 2005, to taking disciplinary action against leaders like Ameril Umra Kato \u2013 head of the 105th base command \u2013 for \u201ccoddling JI leaders\u201d in 2008. ,It\u2019s interesting that when JI leaders brokered the Abu Sayyaf\u2019s move from Basilan and Jolo to MILF camps in central Mindanao in 2003, they talked to Kato. In 2011, Kato and his men broke away from the MILF and formed the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters or the BIFF. ,Kato and his men continued to shelter Marwan until the end. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Part 1: ,EXCLUSIVE: Marwan's ties that bind: Aljebir Adzhar aka Embel, ,Part 2: ,EXCLUSIVE: Marwan's ties that bind: Ren-Ren Dongon,Maria A.

They spotted instead Isnilon Hapilon of the Abu Sayyaf Group faction in Basilan. ,Hapilon, earlier reported to be in ,direct contact with ISIS, and who recently moved his base to the Lanao provinces, was a high value target. The military quickly decided to move in.,The result is the now 7-day old clashes that have driven away most of the city residents and brought the local government to its knees \u2013 and martial law in the whole of Mindanao. (READ: ,Fast facts: Marawi City,),Rappler sat down last May 25 for an an exclusive interview here with Major General Rolando Bautista, the commander who ordered the raid.,Bautista previously ,commanded the Presidential Security Group ,based in Malaca\u00f1ang; he was promoted last March as commanding general of the military's 1st infantry division that has jurisdiction over the Lanao provinces.,To explain what happened, Bautista cited information that the military received \"two to three weeks\" before D-Day.,\"Two to 3 weeks before May 23, we received reports that local terrorist groups will seize Marawi City,\" Bautista said.,It appears now that the military raid \"triggered\" the prematute execution of this plan, he added.,'Target of opportunity',The military worked to validate the information and did observe a consolidation of suspicious personalities in the area. But they could only do so much.,\"In the absence of a signature of them bearing firearms, we just reported that there was consolidation,\" Bautista said.,They also conducted zoning in the area with the help of the local police. \"The goal was to check on locals who are bearing firearms. They isolated those who were residents of the barangay and those who were not,\" Bautista said.,And then, in the middle of all this, Hapilon showed up where they were expecting the Maute Brothers. It was a complete surprise.,In military parlance, it's called a \"target of opportunity.\" The military saw a target it was not expecting but had the ability to capture.,IN COMMAND.

Lorenzana said Hapilon was instructed to scout for a place where a caliphate could be established in Mindanao. (READ: ,Maute Group waves ISIS black flag on Marawi streets,),Bautista talked about Hapilon being the \"emir\" of ISIS in the country. His presence in Central Mindanao was taken by intelligence to mean that he had indeed joined forces with the Maute who had been trying to take Butig, Lanao del Sur.,Thus the military has intensified the hunt for him since.,Hapilon was supposedly severely wounded in an air strike in January, and was in fact presumed by some authorities to be dead.,But the military's intelligence network showed that he's very much alive, reappearing on Tuesday in Marawi City and in the middle of clashes.,As of Sunday, May 28, the military said 13 soldiers and 61 militants have been killed in Marawi.

Here's a quick read to understand the plight of these state-less people.    , ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Rohingya migrants continue to make headlines as they flee Myanmar and seek refuge in nearby countries.,Critics accuse the ASEAN member states of subjecting the boat people, who have suffered months-long starvation and distress, to a game of ,\"human ping pong.\" (WATCH: ,Rappler Talk: Human Rights Watch on Rohingya,),Who are the Rohingya? Why are they at sea? See the information below to understand the plight of these people.,1. Who are the Rohingya Muslims?, ,The Rohingya are Muslim minorities who speak the ethnic Rohingya language \u2013 an Indo-European language associated with Bengali. They live in northern Rakhine state (formerly called Arakan), a coastal village in Myanmar.,According to Khin Yi, Minister of Immigration and Population, there are around 1.33 million Rohingya people in Myanmar.,The ,Arakan Rohingya National Organization (ARNO), states that these people have been in Myanmar \u201cfrom time immemorial,\u201d and that they trace their ancestry to Arabs, Moors, Pathan, Moghuls, Bengalis, and some Indo-Mongoloid people.,Meanwhile, historical scholars and natives claim that the population is indigenous to the Rakhine state since the 19th century, when the nation was under the British occupancy.,However, Myanmar does not consider the Rohingya people as citizens nor an ethnic group. Only about ,40,000 were recognized by the government and given citizenship,.,2. Why are the Rohingya people not recognized?,GRANT CITIZENSHIP. Bangali (also known as Rohingya) people gather near a tent at a temporary school at Gaung Dokka Muslim refugee camp near Sittwe, Rakhine State, western Myanmar, November 13, 2014. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for an end to discrimination against the Rohingya ethnic Muslim minority. File photo by Nyunt Win/EPA  ,Myanmar President Thein Sein refers to the Rohingya as \"Bengalis\" ,\u2013  implying that they are natives of Bangladesh and, therefore, subject to deportation. However, the Bangladesh government doesn\u2019t acknowledge the community as part of its own either.,The government even disagrees that the group use the term \"Ronghiya\". ,Zaw Htay, a senior presidential official, said,: ,\"If they use the term 'Rohingya' we won't take part in it since we don't recognize this term. The Myanmar government has been protesting against the use of it all along.\",In 1982, the government issued a ,law, that will consider as citizens only those who have settled in the country before its independence in 1948. Minority groups who wish to be officially recognized must present documents as proof that their ancestors lived in Burma prior to 1823.,The Rohingya people claim that their ancestors have resided in Burma since hundreds of years ago. ,However, they do not have proper documentation to prove this,.,In 2014, ,Myanmar presented a controversial plan, to solve the issue: the government will grant the Rohingya citizenship if they change their ethnicity to Bangladeshi. This implies admission that the group is illegal in the country, an idea that most of the Rohingya community rejects.,3. Why did they flee Myanmar?,MIGRANTS. Ethnic Muslim Rohingya migrants, believed to have come from Myanmar and Bangladesh, on an abandoned boat drifting in the Andaman Sea close to Malaysia, southern Thailand, 14 May 2015. Photo by EPA.  ,The Rohingya have been discriminated for decades, which resulted in their attempts at fleeing Myanmar. ,A New York Times report stated, that \"they have been denied citizenship and evicted from their homes, their land has been confiscated, and they have been attacked by the military.\",The United Nations (UN) even acknowledged the community as one of the world's most persecuted minorities.,A major incident involving them happened in 2012, when Muslims were implicated in the gang rape and murder of a Buddhist woman. This resulted in a series of bloody fights between the Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims. A report said at least ,90 people died and 3,000 homes were destroyed, due to the violence.,The government acted on this by confining thousands of Rohingya within cocentration camps wrapped with barbed wires. The camps received very poor food resources and medical aid, resulting in starvation and diseases, even deaths. The police prohibited the Rohingya from leaving the camps.,4. What issues do they face as they flee Myanmar?,TEMPORARY CARE. A Rohingya child eats breakfast as he is given medical treatment at a temporary shelter in Kuala Langsa, Aceh, Indonesia, 17 May 2015. Hotli Simanjuntak/EPA  ,It was believed that some Rohingya have opted to submit their lives to notorious human traffickers than to face the possibility of state genocide by Buddhist extremists. A ,trafficking camp was discovered in May, at a deserted jungle in southern Thailand, where at least 30 dead bodies were retrieved from compromised shallow graves. Other bodies were found merely covered in blankets and left in the open.,The sudden military attention after the discovery of the trafficking camp led smugglers to a more cautious tactic. The Rohingya are placed on boats, away from the land, then released in smaller groups. The attention of the military, however, has frightened brokers and traffickers, causing them to hide. This resulted in hundred thousands of migrants stuck at sea for months.,Horrific stories were also shared by the rescued migrants,. In ,their two-month isolation on boats, they fought over food and for survival. Several Rohingya jumped from their boats, women and children included, while others were thrown off the boats to avoid overcrowding.,Moreover, none of the neighboring countries were willing to accept the Rohingya in fear of the continuous influx of migrants. As of Wednesday, May 20, Thailand and Malaysia said they could only ,provide them temporary shelters, \u2013 days after they were heavily criticized by the international community for turning the boat people away.,5. How do governments respond to the issue?,SAVE ROHINGYA. A group of Aceh students hold a protest rally against their country's official policy to reject further Rohinya refugees by pushing them back out to sea, in Banda Aceh, northern Sumatra, Indonesia, May 19, 2015. Hotli Simanjuntak/EPA  ,Since ,August 2012,, Bangladeshi authorities banned the humanitarian assistances to the Rohingya minorities, leaving them exceedingly helpless and vulnerable.,Other neighboring countries have also turned a blind eye to them,. Thailand, for one, claimed its navy give aid to the boats such as food, water, and basic medications. But the military continues to refuse them entry due to the government\u2019s resistance to migrant settlers.,The Rohingya have also turned to Malaysia by choice due to the country\u2019s mutual predominantly Muslim population. Yet the Malaysian government had ordered the navy to reject them from their lands.,Despite the thousands of asylum seekers recovered in Indonesia by the local fishermen, the Indonesian government clarified that the refugees would remain unwelcome, warning fishermen not to rescue more of these boat people. The government has also stated that the previous group of migrants spared earlier this May could be expelled from the country as well.,Governments from these Asian nations were said to respect the wishes of Myanmar to avoid discussions about the discrimination of the Rohingya at regional gatherings. ,\u2013, research by ,Lealy Galang and ,Alma Fernando/,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/93786-fast-facts-rohingya", "title": "FAST FACTS: Who are the Rohingya?"},

Filipino Julian Rodriguez (second from the left) with other members of the Plastic Tides expedition. Photo courtesy of Julian Rodriguez,The expedition, backed by the Jacques Cousteau Society and National Geographic, requires the team to circumnavigate the island of Bermuda for 10 days using only paddleboards.,The team\u2019s mission is to collect scientific data, document the beauty of Bermuda and encourage people all over the world to take a stand against coastal plastic pollution.,Dubbed the, Plastic Tides, expedition,, it was launched on June 8, in celebration of World Oceans Day, to spread awareness about how the dumping of plastics is endangering the health of seas.,A day before the expedition is launched, Rappler asked Rodriguez what it\u2019s like to be on the brink of an adventure that is as crazy as it is purposeful.,Rappler: Why paddleboards?,Julian:, We're using paddleboards for the expedition mainly because it has a minimal carbon footprint and it's a great way to get anywhere above water. We'll be using a specially made trawl for Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation. This will be the first time that collecting samples will be in its most untouched form  because we won't have a boat motor that will push particles of plastic away from our sample tubes and also possibly put motor oil in the water.,R: Why Bermuda?,J:, Bermuda is located in the Sargasso Sea and essentially is the first to be directly affected by any changes in the Atlantic. So, in contrast to the country's beautiful water and islands, plastic trash not only from the country but other places bordering the Atlantic is slowly and steadily polluting the water and coast.,Typically in terms of disposing of our trash, we're in the mentality of \"out of sight, out of mind.\" If we bring the issue into our sights, then definitely it will be in our minds.,R: What are your specific tasks in the team?,J:, I'm the team photographer and second camera for the documentary. I'll also be helping make sure the team is on schedule for the beach clean-ups and school visits that will be taking place along the 10-day route. ,R: How did you get involved with this project?, ,J:, I worked with Gordon, one of the team members on the set of ,Survivor,. One day, about half a year ago, he decided to send me an email and ask me if I wanted in on a tentative project. The idea was spawned from a National Geographic Young Explorer's workshop and evolved into what it is now. It sounded crazy, but sometimes crazy is what we need to get things done.,R: What made you decide to join?,J:, The big picture is what made me join. Coming from the Philippines, our beaches are sadly worse polluted than many of the beaches I've seen while traveling. (READ: ,Boracay: Paradise lost?,),But we can change that. If we can find proper backing, whatever we come up with here in Bermuda, we're also planning on bringing to the Philippines after this project. (READ: ,Water pollution a rising threat in Coron,),R: What exactly is coastal plastic pollution?,J:, Coastal plastic pollution is exactly what you think: plastic pollution that is near land. These areas are essential to the maintenance of our ocean and, quite frankly, who wants to go to a beach full of litter?,The coast hosts a large variety of marine species and is often the most vulnerable habitats to our society's throw-away culture., , R: What are possible solutions to coastal plastic pollution?, , ,J:, First and foremost, we've got to stop treating our planet like a trash dump. We need to be conscious of what we do with our waste and what type of products we are using. Single-use plastic is the worst offender because it is designed to be thrown away and yet as well to be incredibly durable.,The plastic bottle you throw away today, will wash up on the shores of your great-grandchildren's great-grandchildren. Seriously. Every piece of plastic that has ever been made still exists today. It's just an absurd thing to think about and clearly it's far from sustainable. (READ: ,'Not much improvement in Manila Bay water quality',),This is why the problem needs more than just people making the change. Our team likes to say that it's a people problem that needs a material solution. While certainly our single-use ways are the cause, there are simply too many people accustomed to its convenience to even hope that spreading the word will be the cure.,In the end, anti-plastic legislation and alternative bio-degradable and sustainable materials are where the solution lies. ,R: You've been affiliated with many outdoor/adventure shows like, Survivor, and ,GamePlan,. Do you think being adventurous and into outdoor sports has cultivated a love for nature? In what way?, , ,J:, You're not far off the mark. For me though, it was my love for nature that cultivated my adventurous spirit and my love for outdoor sports. I've always felt a strong connection to Mother Earth and being adventurous has let me enjoy that connection to its fullest.,R: What about this expedition are you most excited about?,J:, Many things, but most excited about? Well, I'd have to say I'm most excited about its potential. If what we do can influence others and can capture the attention of the world, we hope to keep doing ,Plastic Tides, expeditions in different locations all over. We've already got our eyes set on the Philippines and Indonesia.,R: What is your message to Filipinos on caring for the ocean?,J:, My message as a Pinoy is just to \"take the time.\" Take the time to observe how we affect our ocean, take the time to see how much trash is left on the beach and in the water. Take the time to stop and imagine how bad the pollution can get in a few years if we do not do anything. We can't instantly improve our environment but if we take the time to fix it then all those years of pollution can be reversed.

To prohibit a person from serving just because other family members are also in government, or because another family member held the same office, seems unfair.,The political family issue has been a subject of debate in the Philippines for as long as there has been a Philippines. The Constitution specifically prohibits dynasties, with the as-yet-unfulfilled proviso \"as defined by law.\",But despite the spirit of that prohibition, dozens of families have maintained a permanent presence in government for generations, and some have controlled the same positions for decades. Cities and even entire provinces are routinely referred to as the \"territory\" or \"bailiwick\" of one family or another.,In these areas, family members often occupy multiple positions within the administration. One may be mayor, another serving on the city council, and another may even be the congressman for that particular district.,Once an incumbent has held office for the maximum period allowed by law, a relative is offered up as candidate for the position. These candidates run, and are elected, primarily on the strength of their family name, and are widely seen as place-holders for the family head, who typically reclaims the office after sitting out one or two terms.,Setting aside the effects of vote-buying and other political chicanery, Filipino voters in many areas seem to support, and prefer, these families.,Dynasty \u2013 \"a family in which several members are involved in politics, particularly electoral politics. Members may be related by blood or marriage; often several generations or multiple siblings may be involved.\",\u2014 Wikipedia,By that definition, the Bush family in the United States is a dynasty. Father and son have both served as president, two sons have been governors (of different states), and a 3rd son was a congressman. The definition would also apply to the Clintons, with Bill having served as president, and wife Hillary as senator (and possibly soon to be president).,But, although the same definition applies, the Bush and Clinton \"dynasties\" are nothing like their Philippine counterparts. Neither family controls an office or territory the way political families do in the Philippines. In that sense, Philippine political families might be better described as \"oligarchies\":,Oligarchy \u2013 \"a form of power structure in which power effectively rests with a small number of people. These people could be distinguished by royalty, wealth, family ties, education, corporate, religious or military control. Such states are often controlled by a few prominent families who typically pass influence from one generation to the next.\",\u2014 Wikipedia,The key words here are \"power\" and \"control,\" so let's talk about that for a moment.,In business, families often own corporations, and strive to keep control within the family. They do this primarily to protect the family's interests, which essentially means the family's wealth and security., ,Royal families do the same, passing power from father to son (and sometimes to daughter), to protect the family and maintain its wealth. For both royal and corporate families, this is \"the family business.\",Public service, on the other hand, is not a business. Legally, the only \"wealth\" a public servant can acquire is the satisfaction of having improved the lives of his constituents.,Other than a government salary, and a few authorized benefits like housing and transportation, a public servant is not allowed to gain financially from the job. In fact, most positions don't even have a retirement plan. Public service is, by definition, a sacrifice.,Compare that with a career in teaching, another low-paying job that also involves service and sacrifice. Like politicians, teachers spend a lot of their own money, and the job really eats into their personal life, but most teachers dedicate their entire lives to it.,They don't do it to get rich or to become powerful. People become teachers because they truly want to serve, and because they think they have something to offer.,But we don't see families fighting tooth and nail to \"control\" teaching positions, or to pass them on to their children like they do with political positions. Why? Because in teaching there is nothing to gain beyond salary, a modest pension, and a sense of improving the lives of others.,There is no possibility of acquiring wealth or power as a teacher. When a teacher retires, she doesn't offer a relative up to take her place.,Politics, on the other hand, operates under an entirely different paradigm. Quite a few families seem to see public office as a business, investing huge amounts of money to win a particular position, and then maintaining control of that position through a chain of family successors.,In political families, children are often groomed for entry into the family business, and participation is expected.,Some political families go to great lengths to hold their \"territory,\" to the extent of spending large sums of money, engaging in vote-buying and manipulation, and in some cases even maintaining armed groups as a sort of \"royal guard.\",Intimidation, assault, and even assassination are not uncommon tactics. Keeping control of their territory seems to be a very high-stakes affair for some of these public servants.,This raises a very important question. What is there about an elected position that would make someone spend a fortune, engage in all sorts of dirty tactics, and sometimes even kill, to win it?,And why would any family treat it as a family business, worth fighting for, and passing from one generation to the next, when there is no possibility of gaining from it?,Unless...it really is a business.,And why does anyone go into any business? To make money. It's that simple.,A big part of any elected official's job is to be \"in charge of the money.\" A mayor, for example, uses the city budget to pay salaries, build roads, and fund social programs, among other things.,A system of legal requirements, called checks-and-balances, is supposed to ensure the money is used properly, but to be effective that system needs at least a few honest people.,In many areas of government, these checks-and-balances are apparently pretty easy to bypass. Through bribes, kickbacks, \"bonuses,\" and simple loyalty, the people in government who are supposed to safeguard taxpayer money simply turn a blind eye to its misuse.,This is made even easier when some of those people are related to the elected official in charge. It's unlikely that a councilman, for example, who is also the son of the mayor, would ever vote against one of his fathers programs or actions, no matter how questionable it might be.,And it's even more unlikely that the child would challenge the legality of that program. As a result, elected officials easily divert public money, through kickback schemes, sweetheart deals, overpriced projects, and a host of other creative ways to enrich themselves.,In these situations, \"checks-and-balances\" is little more than an illusion.,This, in a nutshell, is the real problem with political families. Strategically-placed family members, as in the case of a mayor whose child is on the city council, or a governor who is succeeded by his wife, can all too easily defeat the checks-and-balances which are designed to prevent a government official from enriching himself at the expense of the taxpayer.,Any effort to legally define a dynasty in the context of Philippine politics, and any laws to limit the power of political families, should focus on ensuring that related elected officials are not allowed to hold positions that would enable them to defeat checks-and-balances, or that one family member is not in a position to protect another who may be doing wrong.,Beyond that, voters have the right to choose whoever they think is best qualified. Or, to be more accurate, voters have the right to choose whoever they want to choose, whether that person is qualified or not!,A dozen members of the same family, all holding elected office simultaneously, are no threat as long as they are not serving in positions where they can defeat check-and-balance safeguards. As long as that condition is met, let them serve!,And one final note.,As I've already mentioned, the real reason the \"political family\" situation exists in the first place is because there is clearly profit in politics. Eliminate the profit factor and you eliminate the draw of elected office as a family business.,If it were not so easy for elected officials to gain financially, the only families that would want their sons or daughters to follow in their fathers' political footsteps would be those who are honestly motivated to serve. And those are the kind of people we truly need in government.,So if we want to reduce the harmful effects of dynasties, we shouldn't try to control the families; we should try to control the profit. The dynasty is another problem that will simply evaporate once its root causes are addressed. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Michael Brown is a retired member of the US Air Force, and has lived over 16 years in the Philippines.

It was simpler when we were children, when all we had to do was put spare change in a coin bank. But like most ,young, working professionals,, I\u2019m beginning to think more and more about things like other sources of income, the ,need for life insurance, or saving up for retirement.  ,The good thing is that information about finance matters are more readily available than before, and are even presented in an easy-to-understand way. Others may even be surprised that a free online curriculum on being financialy independent called the ,Brighter Life Institute, exists, and so I signed up for its first offering called ,Getting Started,.,Surprisingly, ,Getting Started ,was brief but concise and didn\u2019t feature a lot of confusing financial jargon. First time users like myself are bound to take it at a comfortable and leisurely pace since it\u2019s available 24/7. I also found the topics on finance features to be informative and easy to understand.,As someone who just begun his journey towards financial security, I can say that taking the course made me realize several things. Those realizations are:,1. Financial planning is a road we will always travel., ,The module set expectations right at the very start by letting students determine their life stage \u2013 that means where you are in your life journey and not just how old you are. And since it's not about the age, it means that the financial journey is a lifelong one.,2. Financial planning is about commitment and consistency., ,This brings me to my second point: personal finance is a lifelong practice. And for it to be effective and impactful, it must be worked on until it becomes part of a routine or even developed as an instinct to save and invest.,3. Financial planning is personal., ,It is only in BLI that I understood and appreciated how unique financial management styles could be. This actually lessened the daunting feeling I had when I decided to adopt and apply financial planning methods.,4. Financial planning is never just about the money., ,Sure, this may sound like I'm underestimating the simplest definition of financial planning, which is really about having money whenever you may need it. But I now believe that its heart is about achieving your dreams and securing the future of your loved ones, not really about how much you have in your portfolio. ,5. Financial planning should be fun., ,I loved it when Randell Tiongson and Marvin Germo talked about financial products as food. Yes, even using the balanced plate theory. Learning about money management can be fun if you choose to approach it that way.,Though still in its infancy, BLI is a timely addition to the personal finance movement that has inspired many Filipinos to be more savvy and knowledgeable about their money. After ,Getting Started,, I do hope that BLI will deliver on its promise and demonstrate how financial planning can be simple and uncomplicated, much like what we dream for ourselves and the ones we love.,Proof is in the know-how, ,Be it taking an online course like BLI or attending related seminars, it\u2019s important to take that first step towards learning more. Then, like an investment, the basic foundations of financial knowledge can grow exponentially over time. Tangibly, this can mean bigger savings in your bank account and more funds placed into ,smart investments,. But moreover, it can equate to peace of mind and the satisfaction that comes with ,financial security,. ,It will also help to find inspiration in people who are brilliant at financial management. One example is ,Mary Rose Fausto,. A former investment banker, she left the industry to prioritize raising her children. She started training her three sons to develop financial skills and values at an early age. By the time they got to grade school, the boys were already making balance sheets for their allowance.,Today, ,her sons, are all financially independent and are investing their own money wisely. Fausto believes that establishing financial independence is just like preparing for life\u2019s harsh realities. ,\u201cIf from the start you\u2019ve already instilled good money values, you can be confident that when [your child] grows up, enters college, and starts working, \u2018,Hindi magugutom ang anak ko., ,Marunong yan eh.\u201d ,(My child won\u2019t go hungry. He\u2019s capable.),\u201cSo it's useless to say \u2018take this up\u2019 or \u2018do this course\u2019. We all know it's when they follow their passion that they become successful. It's just that hopefully, they don\u2019t go hungry along the way. That is why I say raising your children with [good financial values] is actually arming them with economic self-defense,\u201d she explains.,The same sentiment holds true for everyone, regardless of age.,Financial independence is a fulfilling journey in which there is always something new to learn as your life continues. It\u2019s a matter of establishing good habits and building on those.

Municipal fishermen are catching a 4th of what they had been catching from Philippine seas in the 1970s,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 When Ruperto \"Ka Uper\" Aleroza was just a boy, his fisherman father would walk to the beach, throw a net and catch fish.,From the abundant waters of Batangas, his family could easily earn the equivalent of P1,000 in a day. They could afford to set aside some fish for their own meals and use the profit for the rest of the catch to send the kids to school. ,Ka Uper followed his father's footsteps and became a fisherman at the age of 18. Now he is 61 and things couldn't be more different.,\",Ngayon, kailangan na namin mangutang sa iba para makabili ng makina at bangka at mas malayo. Mahabang oras, malaking gastos, maliit yung kita.,\" ,(Now, we need to borrow money so we can buy a machine for our boats and the fishing area is farther. It takes a long time, we spend a lot and we earn so little.),He's lucky if in a day he can earn in the hundreds. Even then, debts have to be paid. ,His story is the story of most small fisherfolk in the Philippines who, on a daily basis, face dwindling fish supply, polluted ocean waters, climate change, and the threat of displacement from their coastal homes.,Who are the small fisherfolk?,Small fisherfolk, according to the definition set by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), are those who use fishing boats of 3 gross tons or less. They are also known as municipal fisherfolk.,In 2011, there were more than 469,000 municipal fishing boats. Marine municipal fisherfolk caught more than 1.1 million metric tons of fish that year. The most common species of fish they catch are Frigate tuna (,tulingan,), Roundscad (,galunggong,), Indian sardines (,tamban,), anchovies (,dilis,), squid and Yellowfin tuna (,tambakol,).,Commercial fishing vessels, on the other hand, are bigger boats \u2013 more than 3 gross tons. While small fisherfolk are given priority access to fishing grounds within 15 kilometers from the shoreline, commercial fishing vessels can only fish beyond the 15 km zone reserved for the small fisherfolk.,Some local governments, however, allow the bigger vessels from 10.1 to 15 km from the shoreline. ,But enforcing these parameters is tricky because of the \"free access\" nature of the sea. It's much harder to delineate boundaries in a medium that by its very nature shifts and flows.  ,It's led to a world of problems for small fisherfolk. Many commercial boats cross over to the small fisherfolk's fishing grounds. Often, these vessels use large-scale fishing equipment such as trawlers or fine nets which catch everything in their path \u2013 whether mature or juvenile fish.,The result is overfishing and, consequently, dwindling fish catch for the small fisherfolk who were supposed to be given priority access to their own town's marine resources.,In the 1970s, Filipino fisherfolk would catch 20 kilograms of fish a day. Now, they catch only around 4.76 kilograms a day \u2013 barely a 4th of the amount during the good old days. (READ: ,Want to feed the world? Save oceans first,),REBUILDING. A fisherman in Leyte builds a new boat to replace his old boat destroyed by Typhoon Yolanda. Photo by Pia Ranada/Rappler,Can overfishing be conclusively attributed to the commercial fisheries sector?,For starters, BFAR data shows that though around 99% of operators in 2002 were municipal fishermen, commercial fishermen raked in 48% \u2013 almost half \u2013 of total fish production that year, even if they made up only 1.2% of the total number of operators.,This may also explain why poverty incidence among fisherfolk is so high. Almost half (41.4%) of Filipino fisherfolk live below the poverty line, earning them the label, \"poorest of the poor.\",Nature can't keep up,Overfishing is what has forced some small fisherfolk to resort to illegal fishing practices like dynamite fishing and muro-ami, said Aleroza, whose advocacy for the welfare of small fisherfolk led him to serve as the current chairman of the Committee on Fisherfolk Settlement of the National Anti-Poverty Commission-Fisherfolk Council.,According to BFAR Director Asis Perez, some 10,000 incidents of ,dynamite fishing ,are still recorded everyday.,Illegal fishing practices used by some commercial fishing vessels are particularly devastating for fish stocks. Some common practices are the use of trawlers, fish nets with holes less than two centimeters, and payao, a fish aggregating device that uses bright lights to attract big populations of fish. ,These are destructive because they catch all kinds of fish, regardless of size and age. Catching juvenile fish reduces the ability of fish populations to replenish themselves.,According to the World Fish Center, fish are being caught at a level 30% above that  at which they are capable of replenishing themselves.,No wonder BFAR found out that 10 out of 13 major fishing grounds in the country have already been overfished. ,Overfishing is just one of the many threats to fish supply and the fisheries sector. ,Fish stocks \u2013 and the fisherfolk who depend on them \u2013 have to survive alarming ocean pollution levels and climate change. ,Hardly are there coral reefs in the country without plastic wrappers or bottles stuck in holes or crevices where fish used to live. Only around 5% of the country's coral reefs are in excellent condition (White and Cruz-Trinidad, 1998). ,Pasay City collected 127 ten-wheeler trucks of floating garbage from Manila Bay in a span of just 4 days back in 2012. Manila Bay is considered one of the country's major fishing grounds.,Climate change is causing ocean waters to warm up in unprecedented levels, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This can cause widespread coral death. ,The unabated accumulation of large amounts of carbon dioxide in the air is also affecting marine life. Oceans absorb around 25% of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere each year. When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, the acidity of oceans increase. Thus, seawater becomes corrosive to the shells and skeletons of many marine organisms.  ,Living in the 'no dwelling zone',Another threat to fisherfolk is literally closer to home. A ,\"no build zone\" ,policy issued by the government as part of rehabilitation efforts after Super Typhoon Yolanda may not be in the best interest of fisherfolk.,The policy prohibited any structures from being built within 40 meters of the shoreline, recognizing the threat of storm surge and sea level rise to such buildings.,COASTAL HOMES. Most municipal fisherfolk live on the coasts in order to have easy access to their source of livelihood. Photo by Pia Ranada/Rappler,But in March, Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery Panfilo Lacson recommended a change in terms: from \"no build zone\" to \"no dwelling zone.\" ,This would allow buildings, such as resorts and other tourist establishments, within the 40 meters. But no one is allowed to live there. (READ:, Leyte fishermen say no to no-build zone,),\"This is a problem for tourism because what if there are investors who want beach resorts? How can you implement a no-build zone, so to be practical, let's make it a no dwelling zone,\" he Lacson in an ,interview, on ANC. ,The statement was a slap on the face for Aleroza.  ,\",Talagang mawawala kami ng hanapbuhay. Pag na-privatize iyon, may bakod na 'yun, may bayad na 'yun. Pag pumasok ka doon, may entrance fee ka na eh.,\",(We will really lose our livelihood. When the shore is privatized, they will put up a wall, they will charge fees. When you try to go inside, you have to pay an entrance fee.),Most fishermen live on coasts in order to have easy access to the sea. This is where they bring their boats to shore and where they dry their catch.,The government should include small fisherfolk in making guidelines for the \"no dwelling zone\" policy, said a distraught Aleroza.,Some fisherfolk are willing to compromise, said Ariane Jaraplasan of NGOs for Fisheries Reform (NFR). ,\"Based on our discussions with small fisherfolk, they are willing to relocate. They know the risk of living in the foreshore coastal areas. They're willing to move 100 meters as long as they have access to the sea because that's their source of livelihood,\" she told Rappler.,Fisherfolk wishlist,Despite the daunting challenges, Aleroza believes it's not too late to uplift the lives of fisherfolk and save Philippine oceans.,On May 30, a day before National Fisherfolk's Day, he and other fisheries reform advocates will march to Malaca\u00f1ang Palace to submit to President Benigno Aquino III a proposal on how to save Philippine marine resources. ,Entitled \"Roadmap to Recovery of Philippine Oceans,\" the document was collaborated on by various fisherfolk groups; NGOs like Worldwide Fund for Nature, Greenpeace and Save Philippine Seas; and scientists from the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute and Conservation International. ,It details possible solutions to overfishing such as stronger enforcement of marine boundaries and capacity-building for local governments to protect marine resources.  ,The creation of a Department of Fisheries is also another option being mulled by some advocates. Creating a dedicated department instead of just a bureau under the Department of Agriculture may mean bigger funding to beef up the sector.  ,Priority must be given to bringing back healthy marine ecosystems, said Greenpeace Southeast Asia Oceans Campaigner Vince Cinches.,\"Even if you develop the industry, you have to go back to the ecosystem from which the industry thrives. Address the problem of overfishing, address the problem of coral degradation, the problem of disappearing sea grass.\",Even if these solutions are implemented, Ka Uper knows he may never get to fish as his father once did.,\",Mahirap utusin ang kalikasan pero yung pagkasira ng tao sa kalikasan, kayang kontrol-in, (It will be difficult to order nature around but destruction by humans can be controlled).\" ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Filipino fishermen ,image, from Shutterstock", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/59228-philippine-oceans-crisis-small-fisherfolk", "title": "PH oceans in crisis: The sad state of small fisherfolk"},

I had just moved into a new job, and my medical test results showed that my cholesterol and triglycerides were high, and my blood sugar levels were above normal.,And don\u2019t get me started on my body-mass index (BMI). At 5\u20192.5\u201d, my highest recorded weight was 150 lbs., and my BMI category was \u201cObese I.\u201d Although childless, I had been asked a few times if I was expecting or had already given birth, since I had gained 40 lbs. in 4 years. ,No matter how my family and friends tried to reassure me that I still looked okay despite the overall roundness, I ,knew ,deep inside that this wasn\u2019t how I was supposed to be. ,Fast-forward to 12 weeks later, and I had lost exactly 21.5 lbs. without going on some fad \u201cdiet,\u201d surgery, or anything extraordinary.,BEFORE AND AFTER. Happier in the process. Photo provided by Ni\u00f1a Terol,I ,did ,make the decision to completely change my routine, lifestyle, and overall outlook on my health and life. Here are some of the things that I did\u2014and still do\u2014to make that change happen for the long haul.,*,1. Walk to work. ,When I moved into a new job, I also made the decision to move closer to my new office for two reasons: (1) to avoid the horrendous cross-city traffic that would waste so much time and money; and (2) to start walking to work every day. It was one of the best decisions I had ever made.,My daily walk takes around 20 minutes both ways, acting as my warm-up and cool-down for the day. It also jump-started my entire system to get moving again from what used to be a completely sedentary lifestyle.,GET MOVING., ,Try something out of your comfort zone, like trapezing! ,2. Move, move, MOVE. ,Once I had gotten used to walking to and from work, I also made the decision to move about as much as I could. I followed expert advice to get up from my desk every 90 minutes\u2014time that I also use when I need a writing break or when I need to talk to some colleagues on the other end of the office.,I\u2019ve also tried editing material while standing up\u2014just to keep myself awake and alert while reading otherwise sleep-inducing drafts. ,I\u2019m also fortunate enough to work in an office with a (free) gym just in the same floor, so I started out by doing some slow cycling on the exercise bike\u2014while reading a work-related book\u2014either during the lunch break or after work.,Once my body felt strong enough, I moved to the treadmill and did 30-minute power walk sessions after work. I have since \u201cgraduated\u201d to running on the treadmill for 30 to 40 minutes per session, at least two times a week on weekdays. ,On weekends, I make sure to wake up early enough to catch the morning sun and jog around the neighborhood by 8AM.,3. Get fit with friends. ,Thanks to a friend who invited me to check out a Zumba class, I now get to dance Zumba at least once a week\u2014burning a lot of calories while getting fit, making new friends, ,and, having fun.,I also realized in the process that I enjoy dancing even if I don\u2019t have a dance background and am not even very good at it. So aside from Zumba, I\u2019ve also started dancing salsa with friends\u2014and taking every possible opportunity to just dance and move to good music.,Aside from that, I have a best friend who\u2019s a yoga teacher and a cousin who used to be a personal trainer. Once I opened up to their guidance and support, I\u2019ve been able to incorporate more balanced practices into my everyday routine and lifestyle. ,4. Junk the (bad) carbs. ,This is important: No matter how much you move, you won\u2019t get healthy enough unless you junk the bad carbs from your system. This includes such Filipino staples as white rice, white bread, white pasta, and all sorts of sweets, pastries, and ,merienda, fare. For me, cutting the rice, bread, pasta, and pizza was easy\u2014it\u2019s cutting out the chocolates and the sweets that continues to be a challenge.,This is also where the ,conscious, active, decision to be fit and healthy kicks in: I\u2019ve realized that for our bodies to change, we first have to change our minds about \u201cthe way things have always been done.\u201d,This has meant redefining what constitutes a \u201cgood meal\u201d, as well as getting my family on board about healthier options during family get-togethers.,5. Train your taste buds. Substitute. ,So if you can\u2019t eat white rice, white breads, and pasta, what ,can ,you eat? Some prefer eating red or brown rice, or whole grain bread and pasta, which contain more nutrients than their whiter, refined counterparts.,I, on the other hand, have decided to junk those altogether and instead use salads and vegetables for my everyday meals. ,I love the fact that pre-washed salad packs are now readily available in supermarkets and convenience stores\u2014it takes the guesswork out of my meals and makes it easier for me to eat healthy. For me, \u201clettuce is the new rice.\u201d (It looks prettier on Instagram photos, too!),Also, if you must absolutely use sweeteners for your drinks, go for stevia or agave instead of white sugar or even artificial sweeteners with aspartame. Both stevia and agave are plant-based, are sweeter, and have a lower glycemic index than white sugar, preventing a \u201csugar crash\u201d and nasty cravings later on.,Other substitutions you can make: tea instead of coffee, dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa) instead of milk chocolate, lemon water instead of fruit juices (which are also high on sugar, especially if they\u2019re processed and artificial), vinaigrette instead of heavy dressings, clear soup instead of creamy soups, and herbs and spices instead of artificial flavors. All those little choices add up, and will contribute to a healthier you in the long run.,6. Redefine \u201chappy meals.\u201d ,Apologies to the big, corporate fast food chains out there, but my new idea of a \u201chappy meal\u201d is a meal that: (a) is good for me and my body; and (b) I\u2019ve lovingly prepared for myself, right from my own kitchen.,I used to think that cooking my own ,baon ,was such a hassle\u2014especially since I cook for just one. But once I realized that cooking for myself was an act of self-love and self-nurturing, I\u2019ve come to enjoy preparing my own meals and see it as my way of taking care of myself. (If I don\u2019t do it, who else will?), ,7. Reimagine trips and buffets. ,My big test came when I had three consecutive weekends of out-of-town trips and access to buffets. Instead of enjoying the fluffy hotel linens and sleeping in like I used to do, I chose to enjoy early-morning beachside jogs, laps in the pool, and detoxing in the hotel sauna\u2014aside from the off-site trips where I walked and moved around as much as I could.,I also used the buffets as opportunities to choose healthier dishes that I normally don\u2019t get to prepare at home.That meant muesli and fresh fruits for breakfast, and different kinds of salad and seafood for lunch and dinner. The takeaways: more confidence to wear a bathing suit and a good, lasting tan.,8. Move on from a heartache. ,There truly is nothing like a major heartache to motivate you to lose weight, get fit, and take better care of yourself. ,But instead of gorging on ice cream and chocolates while watching sappy rom-coms, I did the opposite: I went out there and rediscovered the things that truly meant so much to me but were just buried beneath a gazillion other obligations.  I used the space left by the old to make way for the new, and I\u2019m healthier and happier because of it.,A bonus: when someone new comes along to inspire you, you\u2019re already a much better version of yourself\u2014inside and out\u2014than you used to be. , ,9. Set measurable goals. ,There\u2019s a saying that goes, \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t get measured doesn\u2019t get done.\u201d At the start of the 12 weeks, I challenged myself to lose 40 lbs.\u2014without spending on expensive diets and programs\u2014in just four months. I set certain special occasions as milestones, and I\u2019ve kept my eye on the ball since then.,I\u2019ve also challenged myself to run a 3K race next month and a 5K race by December, with guidance from my trainer-cousin.,I obviously won\u2019t be able to lose the extra 18.5 lbs. in just four more weeks, but I know that I\u2019ll at least come close to my goal and will end up much healthier and happier than when I started out.,10. Cut yourself some slack. ,I admit\u2014there were two weeks out of the 12 when I ,really ,indulged in ,a lot ,of dark chocolate goodies, some heavy red meats, and ,paella ,(my all-time favorite dish). I\u2019ve also had the occasional pizza and (again, dark chocolate) cake slice for colleagues\u2019 birthdays.,I still drink wine and craft beer when going out. But that\u2019s the beauty of this new lifestyle I\u2019m on: I am ,not ,on a \u201cdiet\u201d, which means I\u2019m not going to deprive myself of little indulgences when the occasion calls for it., ,Sustainable path,I\u2019d like to believe that I\u2019m on a more sustainable path to health and wellness\u2014which means no feelings of deprivation, no mood swings, no hunger pangs, and no cravings. I\u2019m eating well, taking better care of my body, but also listening to myself when I need a cup of hot cocoa.,I\u2019m also enjoying life and the company of family and friends, and I\u2019m not going to be the party pooper just because there are bad carbs on the table. Life is about balance, after all.,I\u2019m pretty confident that, with a more loving attitude toward my body and soul and with the support of family and friends, I\u2019m not only going to reach my ideal weight, I\u2019ll also be able to keep it off and live healthier for the rest of my life. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Note: The author is sharing the results of her own experience and is not a trained medical professional.

However, poverty continues to be an obstacle. ,In their household, food is often just a small piece of fish, soup, and rice. Sometimes, they only get to eat fresh fish when there's extra money. To at least \"improve the taste,\" vetsin is usually added to the otherwise bland meal despite health risks.,Melcha's mother is aware that her children aren't getting the right nutrients and they often get sick because they're not well-nourished.

Future leaders \u2013 both local and national \u2013 should aim to champion and carry on the fight against child malnutrition and ultimately, poverty.,NO ONE LEFT BEHIND. Save the Children calls for immediate action to end hunger and poverty in the Philippines. Screenshot from Save the Children's campaign video ,End poverty, end malnutrition,The latest National Nutrition Survey (NNS) results of the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) show that two out of 10 children under 5 years old are underweight, while 3 out of 10 are too small for their age \u2013 or stunted, an indication of chronic malnutrition.,The 1,st, quarter 2015 Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey found that around 7.9 million Filipino families are ,food-poor,. This means that they do not have enough money to buy food. Meanwhile, the Food Consumption Survey of FNRI found that ,7 in 10 households, do not get the right amount of nutrients.,Breaking the inter-generational cycle of malnutrition, according to Olney, requires ending the same cycle of poverty.,\u201cPoverty creates malnutrition and malnutrition keeps people in poverty,\u201d he stressed. \u201cWe have not seen poverty really going down so these poor families are where the malnourished children come from.\u201d,The existence of poverty worsens malnutrition conditions in the Philippines. The NNS results showed that malnourishment largely affects children in poor households or communities.,The lack of resources from their end hinders them from getting the right nutrients. (READ: ,Is the minimum wage enough for a day's worth of nutritious meals?,),To ultimately see the end of the cycle, government should find ways to eventually promote inclusive growth.,\u201cWe have to come up with broad economic policies to look at how to reduce poverty and how to get more families to enjoy the economic progress the country is enjoying at large,\u201d Olney said.,However, these policies should be sustainable enough and be given right budget allocations. It is also important, he added, that anti-poverty programs are implemented well while providing the needs of those burdened.,\u201cWe need to ensure that there's a greater level of resources that get to these poor families,\u201d Olney said.,Collaboration is key,Save the Children, through its latest campaign, calls for commitment not just from the government but also from the public to \u201cexhaust all means to ensure children get the right nutrition they deserve.\u201d,Hunger and malnutrition, the group added, is really everyone\u2019s business.

It is done every 5 years by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST). ,There have been 8 surveys done so far. This year, the FNRI surveyed almost 36,000 rural and urban households. ,Long history of influence             ,The main purpose of the survey mandated by Executive Order 352 is to \u201cgenerate critical data\u201d to help government offices and even the private sector in decision-making and policy formulation.,According to Dr Cecilia Acuin of the NNS team of FNRI, the NNS results are often dismissed by people.,\u201c,Maraming mas hindi napapansin na influence ang survey results,,\u201d she said. \u201c,Pero nandoon sa mga programang ginagawa ng gobyerno.,\u201d (Many do not notice the influence of survey results.

As an agency, according to Lacuin, the Institute can only do so much.,\u201c,Hindi kami ang implementing agency eh,,\u201d she explained. \u201c,Usually ang DOH, sila ang kailangan naming batuhan ng data para kalampagin na gumawa ng mga aksyon.,\u201d,(We are not an implementing agency. It\u2019s DOH we pass on data to and pressure to take action.),When the levels of anemia increased in previous surveys, the FNRI drew the attention of DOH. In response, they started giving iron supplements to women and children at the local level.,The, Philippine Food Fortification Act of 2000, is one of the policies that emerged from the results. One of its well-known inclusion is the Sangkap Pinoy Seal Program (SPSP), which instructed food manufacturers to fortify processed goods with essential nutrients approved by the Department of Health (DOH). Goods that followed the order were encouraged to mark their goods with a seal remembered mostly by today\u2019s young adult generation. (READ: ,Hunger problem: It's not all about food now,),Another is the ,Asin Law, that addresses iodine deficiency disorders in the country. Through this law, local government units were required to ensure that establishments, from town markets to neighbourhood eateries, made use of the Iodized Salt. This was implemented in 1995. (READ: ,Take it with a grain of 'iodized' salt,),Intensified lobbying,The FNRI considered the Sin Tax Law as its most \u2018dramatic\u2019 influence.,The law that restructured the tax on alcohol and tobacco products was enacted in 2012 after a controversial run in both houses of Congress. (READ: ,Aquino signs historic sin tax bill into law,) ,In 2008, adults aged 20 years old and above who smoked reached 31%.,Dr Dante Morales, chairperson of the Multi-Task Force of the National Nutrition and Health Survey, said that it was the results of the 2008 NNS on smoking that helped pass the law. They were presented to Congress during deliberations. (READ: ,After 15 years, sin tax bill hurdles Senate,) ,SMOKING. Smokers among the poor and the young are decreasing.,The prevalence of smokers decreased by almost 5% between 2008 and 2013. From 31%, it is now down to 25.4%.,Meanwhile, Research Specialist Charmaine Duante said that the significant decline can be attributed to the recently passed law.,\u201cThe implementation of sin tax may have prevented people from smoking,\u201d she said.,Filling the gap,Acuin also said they are now working to fill the gap by developing Nutrition Practice Guidelines to be made available in community health centers.,\u201c,Maraming guidelines na pang-doctor sa clinic o hospital, sa ating mga health centers naman ay wala,,\u201d she explained. (We have a lot of guidelines for doctors in clinics or hospitals but none in health centers.),These guidelines are used to address non-communicable diseases such as diabetes among the poor sector, if ever implemented.,\u201cYou cannot treat diabetes by just giving medicines. You also have to address the diet and physical activity,\u201d Lacuin explained. \u201cWe're working with DOH in developing these guidelines at the primary care level.\u201d,The results of the last NNS in 2013 are expected to roll out starting July 2014.

By the time the soldiers were ordered to mount a counter-attack, however, they were already faced with a complex combat zone where rebels had taken hostages and entrenched themselves in key defensive positions.,Soldiers by the codename \"Venom,\" \"Dark Knight,\" \"Karambit,\" and \"Wild Orchid\" remember everything that transpired in Zamboanga City from September 9 to 28, 2013 \u2013 the action, the suspense, the drama and even the comedy that came with it.,On September 9, 2013, close to 500 members of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) ,attacked the city, to protest what they considered was government's failure to fulfill the provisions of the peace agreement that the MNLF signed with the Ramos administration in 1996.,Government troops fought back in what would turn out to be the Philippine military's biggest operation in recent history. What followed was a fierce battle that stretched for 3 weeks, killed 19 government forces and 208 rebels, and dislocated 24,000 families. (READ: ,Zamboanga siege: Ground zero a year after,),A year after the siege, Rappler sat down with the elite troops from the Philippine military's anti-terrorist Light Reaction Battalion (LRB) at their headquarters in Nueva Ecija, where they recalled the siege that tested their wit and mettle.,Created in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, the LRB was trained for situations such as the Zamboanga siege. It's a Tier 1 unit, whose, members were plucked from the elite Scout Rangers and the Special Forces. They were trained to either become an assaulter or a sniper \u2013 skills necessary in urban combat, hostage rescue, and neutralization of high value targets,Target: KGK,The first challenge for the LRB was the KGK  Building a,long Lustre street, a 4-story structure with very thick walls that MNLF commander ,Habier Malik, and his followers had turned into a well-fortified base. It would become the most important target for government troops.,MNLF Commander Habier Malik. ,Trained for surgical operations, the LRB troops planned to attack the KGK building. But there was a hitch: they didn't have the floor plan and they lacked enough information on rebel strength and position.,\",Wala kaming, floor plan. ,Pero sabi ng tropa,: Sir, ,kailangan kunin na natin ito ,(We didn't have a floor pan. But the troops said: Sir, we should take this already),\" recalled LRB commander Colonel Teodoro Llamas. ,They found a short route from the back of a hospital compound. The plan was to approach the wall of KGK, bore a hole in the wall, force their way in, surprise the rebels and free the hostages.,It was easier said than done. The plan exposed them to an open terrain and a swampy area. They had to crawl under the cover of darkness, relying on government snipers and machine gunners who would open fire at rebel positions from the roof ,of the nearby Zamboanga City Medical Center.,The troops eventually reached the wall and bore a hole in it while dodging bullets from the enemy side. ,It was about 2 am. ,\",Kung hindi lang sa kasamahan namin nakikipagputukan, katay na kami doon. High risk ang ginawa namin. Medyo ,suicidal, yun e ,(If it weren't for the others who were engaging the rebels, we would have been massacred. It was a high-risk operation. It was suicidal.),\" recalled \"Dark Knight,\" one of those who led the approach.,But it turned out it's not the wall they needed. \",Hindi namin mapasok kasi yung pader pala na papasukan namin ,swamp,. T,apos ,walang access sa mismong, [KGK]. ,Hindi namin alam 'yung, floor plan. ,Walang, access (We coudn't enter because the wall was in a swampy area. It didn't have access to KGK, too. We didn't know the floor plan. It didn't have access),\" recalled \"Venom,\" one of the company commanders reporting to Llamas.,They had to retreat to the hospital. ,COMBAT ZONE: Close quarter battle in the coastal barangays of Zamboanga City. Rappler photo,Mortars, fires, and gun holes,They made a second attempt to seize KGK after lunch on the same day. But the rebels were already alerted, waiting for the soldiers to return.,The troops had to change tactics.,They then went around the building, moving from one street corner to another in tanks, running from house to house, hitting walls with mortars.,But the rebels proved to be well-trained in this type of battle.,\"We suspect that some of them have some sort of a training also. We see styles from Afghanistan or Pakistan. There were 3 layers before you can engage them, \" said Llamas.,Sometimes the rebels fired through holes in several layers of walls. ,It was hard to tell where the bullets were coming from and harder to see where the hostages were kept. ,And then there was the burning of houses and facilities that forced the troops to stop and prevented them from immediately closing in. Sometimes the troops had to sleep in half-burned houses.,The MNLF rebels had two advantages in the prolonged firefight: they had f,ood supplies inside the abandoned houses and they had hostages that they used as shields.,A soldier dies,On their 3rd attempt to take KGK, the elite troops suffered their first loss. They watched Corporal ,Michael Baltazar fall after a surprise attack from a rebel who suddenly appeared from a sewer. , ,Some of the men couldn't help their tears while they were engaging the enemies. \u201c,Kinuha ko ang baril ni, Baltazar. ,Dalawa na gamit ko. Sinabihan ako ng, CO (commanding officer) ,ko na \u201cKalma ka lang,, brother.\u201d ,Sa isip ko, gusto ko na talaga pasukin, KGK, ,(I took Baltazar's firearm and was firing 2 rifles. My commanding officer had to tell me to calm down. In my mind, I wanted to enter KGK),\u201d \"Wild Orchid\" recalled. ,9 LRB troops were killed ,\"Venom\" was wounded, too. A shrapnel hit his left hand and he bled profusely. Llamas had to order a master sergeant to drag \"Venom\" him by the collar to a tank that brought him to the hospital. ,It would take 5 difficult advances until the troops were able to take the building. But by then, the rebels had fled with their hostages. ,On September 18, the troops raised the flag on the roof of KGK and sang the national anthem. But this did not mean the end of the crisis; it only meant the rebels were deprived of a fortified base.,The soldiers continued to pounce on the rebels until they cornered them in a small area.,Hard lessons,Looking back, some of the troops say they should have made their move on Day 1, when one company of Light Reaction troops had the vantage point in a building where they could see the rebels marching with their hostages.,But the soldiers could not do anything. For the first 4 days they were ,paralyzed by negotiations held between government representatives and rebel emissaries for the peaceful surrender of Malik's followers. ,The soldiers told Rappler that during those days they played the battlefield in their minds; they would shoot the enemy, rescue hostages, show immense firepower. But it was tough to fight an imaginary war. When they got impatient, one officer mustered the courage to seek permission to attack. He was rejected.,The go-signal would come only the 5th day, September 13 (Friday the 13th), after President Benigno Aquino III arrived in Zamboanga City. (READ: ,Bungled chances in Zamboanga, and ,Zambo crisis: The fog of war,),By then the rebels had taken defensive positions and camped at the KGK with hostages, putting government troops at a disadvantage.,Worse, the troops were given two \u2013 but somewhat complex \u2013 orders: rescue the hostages and neutralize the enemy. They were two different missions that required different firearms and approaches. ,\u201c,Ano ba talaga sir,?,\u201d junior commanders would ask Llamas. He told them the priority was the safety of the hostages. ,Small team, , ,Llamas lost 9 men in the Zamboanga siege. ,He said he feels guilty that he was unable to visit their graves more often. , ,He also remembers considering to beg off from the operation. \"Technically, we were non-operational. Our unit was not filled up,\" he said. The military has always estimated their number to be 300 but, in fact, they are much smaller. The Zamboanga operation seemed too big for the small unit. , ,But Llamas also knew he couldn\u2019t say no., ,The troops also felt it was a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" operation cut out for them.  ,They've rescued hostages before and have surprised terrorists in their encampments, but there was nothing like the magnitude of Zamboanga City.  There were about 100 hostages held by close to 500 rebels in 5 densely populated barangays. The elite troops' 13 years ,of training would be put to test., ,\"It was the real world. It's no longer training,\" said Wild, ,Orchid, 42, who joined LRB in 2003., ,The crisis would drag for 21 days, too long for a unit that is trained to finish a job in 3 days. In the end, the ,combat zone was  razed to the ground.,The LRB would get help from a company of Navy Special Operations Group (NAVSOG), the equivalent of the US Navy Seals, whose training was closest to the LRB except their expertise is water. The LRB and the Navsog both fall under the Joint Special Operatios Group (JSOG) under the command of , Colonel Danilo Pamonag. (,READ: ,'The first to respond, the last to leave',),The Scout Rangers, too, helped. They occupied the frontlines when the LRB needed to rest. ,Surrounding them were over 2,000 other troops. The Air Force brought in soldiers from the different units nationwide. They conducted air strikes and took snapshots of the battlefield. The Navy guarded the shorelines and the mangroves, while the rest of the Army protected the perimeter of the combat zone. ,Everyone made sure that the rebels couldn't escape and they couldn't be reinforced., ,Deaths and injuries,In the hospital, \"Venom\" made sure he was released immediately when he learned that his platoon leader also died in combat. He wanted to return to his troops but Llamas said no. Llamas was planning to ,assign another officer to take Venom's place as company commander.,Llamas recalled how an angry \"Venom\" stared at him when he received the orders. The battalion commander stared back at the junior officer. Nobody said a word until \"Venom\" teared up. ,Llamas is laughing now but it was no laughing matter back then. ,\",Parang drama e. Kung gagawin mong, cartoons ,yun at may, talk bubble,, ang sinasabi niya sa akin,: ,P@*!!#!! mo, sir. ,Huwag mong gawin sa akin ito ,(It was so dramatic.

And yet, as I have grown older I have come to realize that my future and the future of my country is inextricably tied to the fate of the Arctic. ,When I spoke out at the ,United Nations (UN) talks in Warsaw, last November 2013 to demand immediate and drastic action in the wake of ,Typhoon Yolanda, (Haiyan), I did not expect to become a YouTube hit. I had just spoken with my brother who was at home, and who had been helping to recover the bodies of the victims.,Typhoon Haiyan was the deadliest typhoon in the history of the Philippines, with over 6,200 people dead, 1.9 million homeless and more than ,6 million displaced,.

That global expression of support touched me at a time of great personal grief, and in that dark moment offered a ray of renewed hope. ,A story in the north,So why am I, a climate negotiator from the Philippines, looking north? The reason is that the Arctic remains at the very center of the unfolding story of a man-made climate crisis, and of our response to it. The seven summers with the lowest minimum sea ice extents have all occurred in the last seven years. It is an extraordinary tale with consequences that reach far beyond the Arctic Circle.,Greenpeace ship from EPA.,This is a story of epic proportions, set in a stunning icy landscape, with a complex and fascinating geography. The sea ice reflects the sun\u2019s energy, while frozen permafrost keeps methane locked underground, and the Greenland ice sheet stores water that when melted would cause dangerous sea level rises. Increased warming could stop and reverse all of these vital functions. In other words, what happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic. (READ: ,West Antarctic ice sheet collapse unstoppable': NASA,),It is also a story with a twist of tragic irony ,\u2013, as the ice cap shrinks the oil companies are moving in hoping to reap profit from the oil reserves that are only now accessible because of the melt.,As I take stock of the damage caused by Haiyan, and resolve to head to yet another round of UN climate negotiations, I can hardly believe that there are some companies who would undermine all our efforts by heading north to find and drill for new fossil fuels.,Global oil demand that would justify, on economic terms, exploitation of Arctic oil reserves would have a catastrophic impact on the climate, leading to global average temperature increases of over 6 degrees C.,Those oil and gas companies seeking to drill in the Arctic are showing total disregard for efforts of preventing dangerous climate change.,The Arctic Declaration,It is for this reason that I have signed the ,International Declaration on the Future of the Arctic,,, which calls on the international community not only to re-double its efforts to tackle climate change, but also to work with the Arctic states to take steps to safeguard the polar environment.,The declaration is a charter for Arctic protection. For me the most compelling reason to sign was simple. There can be no rational international response to climate change that permits the expansion of oil drilling into the newly melted areas of the Arctic.,The people of the Arctic and the sovereign states of the region have a huge privilege and responsibility.,As custodians of an incredible landscape and eco-system they are among the first to bear witness to the impacts of climate change. The melting glaciers and the shrinking sea ice must rank as some of the most dramatic environmental changes in human history.,However, this story is far from finished. Indeed the next chapter is as yet unwritten.,Will we take this moment to take stock of our past and our future?  Will we protect the Arctic for generations to come, or will we allow the Arctic Ocean to be polluted and exploited for yet more fossil fuels?,In our response to the Arctic crisis we will be judged by posterity. ,- Rappler.com,Yeb Sa\u00f1o is chief UN climate negotiator for the Philippines.

But the water firm, including Maynilad, said they will pursue legal options to assert the provisions in their contracts regarding rate-rebasing.,Thus Manila Water disputed the rate reduction before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).,The ICC appeals panel though slashed Manila Water\u2019s basic water charge by 11.05%, equivalent to a decrease of P2.77 ($0.0623) per cubic meter., The basic water charge reduction would be staggered for 3 years.,A reduction of P1.66 ($0.037) per cubic meter would be implemented this year; P0.55 ($0.012) per cubic meter in 2016; and P0.55 ($0.0124) per cubic meter in 2017.,Manila Water is a public utility and therefore cannot pass on its corporate income tax to consumers, the arbitration panel also ruled.,Public utility?,Manila Water president and Chief Executive Officer Gerardo Alblaza Jr said Tuesday, April 21 that while the while the arbitration decision resolved specific issues raised by Manila Water, the company though is deeply concerned that it ruled the utility firm as a \u201cpublic utility.\u201d,Ablaza said the ruling differs significantly from the government\u2019s original representation during the 1997 bidding for private sector participation in the operation of MWSS.,\u201cThat Manila Water will be an agent and contractor of MWSS which will continue to be the public utility. This decision fundamentally changes the concession agreement,\u201d he added.,Ablaza said Manila Water will study the implications of the arbitral ruling on the treatment of corporate income tax.,\u201cWe\u2019ll actively work with the government toward ensuring the sustainability of excellent service to east zone consumers under this new arrangement,\u201d Ablaza said.,Manila Water provides water and wastewater services in the east zone of Metro Manila covering Makati, Mandaluyong, Pasig, Pateros, San Juan, Taguig, Marikina, and parts of Manila and Quezon City, as well as Rizal province. It also has projects through subsidiaries in Laguna, Pampanga, Boracay, and Cebu.,Meanwhile, west zone concessionaire Maynilad Water Services Incorporated  secured a favorable ruling from the appeals panel.,The ICC appeals panel upheld Maynilad\u2019s alternative rate rebasing adjustment, which would result in a 9.8% increase in the 2013 average basic water charge of P31.28 ($0.71) per cubic meter.,This is inclusive of the P1 ($0.0223) Currency Exchange Rate Adjustment that the MWSS incorporated into the basic charge, translating to an average increase of P3.06 ($0.069) per cubic meter in its basic charge.,Maynilad was also allowed to recover its corporate income tax. In an earlier briefing, Maynilad said the provision for income tax recovery would make up P2 ($0.045) of the average increase in basic water charge.,Maynilad is co-owned by Pangilinan-led Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (MPIC) and Consunji-controlled DMCI-Holdings Incorporated.,Conflicting decisions,Because of these conflicting decisions on Manila Water and Maynilad, the MWSS would bring the decision to court.,\u201cThere is a need to settle this,\u201d said MWSS Chief Regulator Joel Yu.,Yu added that the MWSS legal counsel will determine the proper court but Yu is hoping the matter will go directly to the Supreme Court.,\u201cIt will be very soon as there is a sense of urgency,\u201d he added.,Maynilad services the west zone of Metro Manila covering Manila (all but portions of San Andres and Sta Ana); Quezon City (west of San Juan River, West Ave.) EDSA, Congressional, Mindanao Ave, northern part of the districts of Holy Spirit and Batasan Hills; Makati (west of South Super Highway); Caloocan; Pasay; Para\u00f1aque; Las Pi\u00f1as; Muntinlupa; Valenzuela; Navotas; and Malabon, cities of Cavite like Bacoor and Imus and towns of Kawit, Noveleta, and Rosario. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,US$1 = P44.23", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/business/industries/90658-manila-water-loses-arbitration-appeal", "title": "Arbitration body to Manila Water: Cut basic water charge"},

Senator Sergio Osme\u00c3\u00b1a III in his office before his last senate session. Photo by Patricia Evangelista ,I am Serge Osme\u00f1a,. I\u2019m 72 years old, and I\u2019m about to be a former senator.,I grew up with politics,. My grandfather, Sergio Osme\u00f1a Sr. was in public service for 42 years. He was the first speaker the Philippine national assembly at the age of 29 and rose to the ranks, became a senator, and later on secretary, the first secretary of education, vice president, and then president. My father became governor, congressman, mayor of Cebu and eventually a senator.,There were several options for me other than becoming a politician,. As a matter of fact my first economic exercise was farming. And that was pretty interesting to me. Also had some trading, construction, small small businesses here and there. So we had options, unfortunately, those options were cut off when I was arrested and thrown into detention when I was 28.,They never told me why I was arrested., There was no arrest order and after two years of having been in detention, my roommate (then) Geny Lopez and I went on a hunger strike. Because we insisted that the charges be filed and given to us.,Remember, we had no access to lawyers., So, after the hunger strike they finally came up with a set of charges and said we were accused of attempting to murder the president. So I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take me to court? You\u2019ve had me here for two years, you won\u2019t allow me to see a lawyer\u201d. And they said no we won\u2019t take you to court we will re-investigate. You\u2019re going to re-investigate something that you\u2019ve investigated to death? And they said \u201cYes, we will do that\u201d. So they did, another two years then they came up with a different decision, decided to charge us with rebellion, which is a political crime.,My father had run against Ferdinand Marcos for the presidency in 1969,, so they were were political enemies. Unfortunately he was abroad. I suspect that in order to keep him quiet, they had to take someone hostage, and the same thing with my roommate, Geny Lopez.,That was a very smart political move on the part of the dictator, because what he was saying is, to the people is, \u201cYou guys better behave. Look I\u2019ve got Ninoy Aquino, your political idol, I\u2019ve got the scion of the Lopez group here, in prison. If I can do that to them, I can do that to any of you. So it was a smart move.,My roommate and I decided that I\u2019m not gonna say sorry for something we didn\u2019t do., We were just gonna get out of here and escape. So we planned an escape from maximum security in Fort Bonifacio and by the grace of God we got lucky and we went to Hong Kong, Japan, and L.A. so it was the fastest escape. I think we landed in L.A. in 33 hours after we broke out of our window. And I had to live in exile for about 14 years.,95% of the Filipinos who\u2019ve been interviewed with regards to martial law say martial law never touched their lives. ,Which is true, there are only a few maybe 70,000, hundred thousand people who were arrested, beaten up, tortured, killed, salvaged. The rest were not touched so they were right. It\u2019s the morality of the whole thing that is in question.,I think the whole world acknowledges that Marcos is one of the worse plunderers in world history. ,He\u2019s in the Guiness Book of World records, his name is always mentioned. I just read his name again the day before yesterday, when I was one of the international opinion columns. This is something we don\u2019t want our kids to ever forget.,I would not be pleased with another Marcos as president. ,Well, I am just trying to be honest because he (Ferdinand \u201cBong-Bong\u201d Marcos) was a very personable fellow and we were together in the Senate. We served together and he was very nice to me. But because of the position he has taken that he would not apologize for the sins of his father, and he would not admit that they were wrong, and then it goes to speak about his value system. If that was okay, then he\u2019ll do it again. That disturbs me.,The philosopher George Santayana said, \u201cthose who do not remember the lessons in the past are condemned to repeat them.\u201d, And we should not repeat them. It would be awfully dumb if we were to repeat the same mistake.,Does make us awfully dumb? ,A few of us, yes.,***,I was at home when they started coming out with the results of the elections, and I was coming in number 14. It was about 7 o\u2019clock at night or 8 o\u2019clock at night (that) I said, \u201cUh oh, they done me in.\u201d,The next day when I woke up I felt good., I said, now I don\u2019t have to work so hard anymore. See, there are plus and minuses. I looked at the plus \u2013 what\u2019s the plus \u2013 I don\u2019t have to work so hard anymore. Legislative work for me was very difficult.,I didn\u2019t lose, and I\u2019d like to tell those who voted for me that we didn\u2019t lose.,I don\u2019t think my campaign failed in any phase whatsoever except in the anti-cheating phase., Alright? I was steady number 6 to number 9 all throughout all surveys. All surveys! And I was pretty comfortable with where I was.,It is easier to win a national campaign than a local campaign. ,Why? Because we can discuss issues, we can discuss policy, and the local campaign is a totally different value system. See, the Filipino voter votes on two levels, and people don\u2019t realize this, so this is another myth. (At) the local level, they vote culture and debts of gratitude. So whether you\u2019re a naughty man or a good man, all the father has to say is, \u201cYou know, we need to support the mayor, because when your mother was sick last year, he was the one who paid for the hospital. We have a debt of gratitude to him.\u201d,At the national level, we don\u2019t have the opportunity to do those types of favors,. That\u2019s 54 million voters for goodness\u2019 sake. So, they tend to see the way you are as you project yourself in the media. And they\u2019ll say, \u201cOkay, he\u2019s saying the right thing, I like what he\u2019s saying,\u201d or, \u201cHe seems to be a decent guy,\u201d and that\u2019s why they\u2019ll vote for you.,What stands for political parties in this country are nothing but political cliques,, and I don\u2019t know why people are surprised when they see a say Congressman jumping now from the Liberal Party to the PDP-Laban. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been. Since the start.,T,he speakership has always been an appointive position in our system, because the Congressmen are under the control of the president, because of the president\u2019s control over the pork barrel.,We pretend it\u2019s an elective position,, but you can see it right now that it\u2019s not.,I remember there was one newly-elected president who broached to me an idea of making somebody from the opposite party to be Speaker. ,So I told him, \u201cMr. President if you want your personal driver to be speaker he will be speaker.\u201d And he thought I was kidding and he said \u201cAre you serious or are you kidding?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. That\u2019s an appointive position. The president appoints the speaker. So go ahead and select the one you want to be speaker and watch everybody fall in line.\u201d And that\u2019s what happened.,There\u2019s so many myths about political campaigning about name recognition., That\u2019s not the way voters make their selection. You have to take the voter through a series of phases before he will actually be convinced to vote for you.,The first phase is called the awareness phase., \u201cDo you know Serge?\u201d If you don\u2019t know Serge, if they don\u2019t know Serge, how can they vote for Serge? That\u2019s what you call your introductory phase, awareness phase.,The second phase, after they get to know you, is the endearment phase. ,Do I like Serge? ,Baka sabihin nila,, \u201c,Oo kilala ko nga si ,Serge ,pero medyo mayabang,.\u201d ,Ah wala ka na, tapos ka na,. \u201cOh, ,okay si, Serge ,mukhang mabait, mukhang simpatico naman, mukhang may alam,.\u201d That\u2019s the endearment side. Do I like Serge?,The last part is \u201cWhy should I vote for Serge?\u201d, ,That\u2019s the acceptance., What does he stand for? What\u2019s his program? What\u2019s his history, on various issues? So when they say \u201c,Eh nanalo ka kasi meron kang pangalan, kilala na,.\u201d I said no. There have been, including me now, 36 senators who have not been re-elected to the Senate. There goes name recognition argument. So that\u2019s another myth. As a matter of fact in this country, endearment is more important even than acceptance.,I\u2019m also the sort of person that if I have time, if I have energy, I\u2019ll devote some of my time and energy to other candidates,. I like to develop young people. So I like to help them, I like to teach them. This is the way you should campaign. This how you formulate your message. This is the way you should handle certain things and certain issues as they crop up. So, I helped Leni Robredo. I helped Grace Poe.,If I did nothing but concentrate on my own candidacy I would have gotten 5% higher ,but I didn\u2019t because I felt that it\u2019s worth the sacrifice.,I also made maybe a tactical error ,in devoting so much time to the hearings on the anti-money laundering issue, the one that involved the $81 million, but I felt as chair of the banking committee it was an opportunity to explain to the Filipino people the danger of having an anti-money laundering law so full of loopholes. We have been warning about that for the past 15 years.,That took up half of my campaign time. ,But I was still winning that\u2019s the whole point. Being a student of political campaigning management, [I think that] if you\u2019re in the winning column, you\u2019re not just going to drop.,Of course I could have increased my margin. ,But still, you\u2019re not supposed to be cheated. That\u2019s what happened.,I\u2019m not going to file a protest,. It\u2019s gonna take too long. What I like to see is for Congress to make the corrections, amendments to the automation law to make it more transparent.,Transparency means credibility of the election process.,Political endorsements will only work if the personality endorsing is related to the issue involved in the campaign,. Otherwise, they\u2019re just merely celebrities. It does\u2019t work.,Political campaign managers in other countries are not candidates themselves and never have been candidates., They just know the process. An advertising fellow has never been a candidate, but he knows advertising. So that\u2019s the way that works.,I think that I know maybe more about political campaign management than the average politician. ,***,I would consider myself a liberal. ,If the government recognizes annulment, why don\u2019t they just call it divorce, instead of pretending, \u201cI was not psychologically qualified to get married to you.\u201d That\u2019s a bit of \u2013 in the words of (President-elect Rodrigo) Duterte \u2013 is bullshit.,I am not for the death penalty., I was glad when we finally voted against it. I did some homework on it, and it shows that there is no relationship between death penalty and bringing crime down. For example, how many states in the United States still have death penalty? They still have drugs and murder and fraud, etc, so there\u2019s no connection.,We, ,have to make sure that we are aware that mistakes that can be made, and one innocent life is not worth the whole sacrifice.,I am for LGBT rights,. ,Why is it wrong?, It\u2019s the church who\u2019s saying it\u2019s wrong, but you know, they\u2019re not always correct.,They just have different preferences\u2014why would I blame them for that?, Why would I penalize them for that? They have the same right to fall in love as any human being does.,I don\u2019t even consider myself part of a dynasty, because we don\u2019t coordinate with each other, we don\u2019t protect each other, we fight with each other most of the time, except for my brother. I don\u2019t fight with my brother.,I am not against the anti-dynasty provision of the Constitution, but what I\u2019m saying is that, define it. ,Where I am able to affect the outcome of the elections, ,that I would consider a dynasty. ,I\u2019m not trying to project a certain image of Serge Osme\u00f1a, I never have., I\u2019ve got so many things to do I don\u2019t really the time to bother with that.,I\u2019ll take positions that sometimes are not too popular. But, okay, that\u2019s what I believe in., Like for example, I suppose many groups don\u2019t agree that I support the RH law, and many groups were not agreeing that I\u2019m in favor of legalizing divorce. Many groups will not agree that I\u2019m in favor of abolishing the death penalty. I mean those can be really very controversial issues. I remember, the one who filed the RH law; about 10, 15 years ago, a fellow senator, his cellphone was clogged with the worst most poisonous text messages like, \u201cyou are the son of satan,\u201d (or) \u201cyou\u2019re a devil from hell.\u201d And I knew what we had to go through to get that bill passed. Eventually it took us ten years but we did get to pass that into law.,\u2022\u2022\u2022,I stand for a lot of things., I stand for democracy, I stand for liberty, I stand for freedom, I stand for honesty, and lots of things that we don\u2019t have now.,I do feel very strongly, that more Filipinos should get more actively involved in politics.,A statesman is somebody who puts the welfare of the nation ahead of his own or that of his political party., That to me is the definition of a statesman, he puts the State ahead of everything else.,There are lots of statesmen in government., Maybe not as many as we would want, and that\u2019s because of the system that we have allowed to develop in our country. We have no real political parties here, except the Communist Party.,I\u2019ll let historians judge if I\u2019m a statesman., I\u2019d be flattering myself if I thought so, but be that as it may I will say that I always tried to handle myself in the same manner that my grandfather would have handled himself. And I hope that, I think that has guided me in the right direction and I hope that future historians will be able to recognise that.,Anything I\u2019ll miss? ,I don\u2019t know. I felt that there were still laws that I had to sponsor, pending in my committee, which were the committees on energy and the committees on banks. For example, the anti-money laundering amendment, the nth time I would sponsor it again if I were there. So, yeah, there was some unfinished business that I wanted to take care of.,My only son has always shown interest in politics for the past ten years,. He asked if he could help with my office campaign, I said no. Pay attention to your career. And later on, when I\u2019m gone, and you\u2019re 40 years old, and you\u2019re financially independent, and will not be tempted \u2013 there\u2019s a big temptation in the government \u2013 and you will not allow yourself to be tempted in any shenanigans, then go for it if you can serve your people.,I named him Jose Lorenzo.,  Jose Diokno Lorenzo Ta\u00f1ada Osmena. I named him after ka-Pepe and ka-Tani. People thought I named him after Jose Rizal and and St. Lorenzo, but I said no, these are two other saints. Diokno and Ta\u00f1ada.,He\u2019s only in his 20\u2019s,. He\u2019s not going to be earning enough to support himself and the lifestyle that he\u2019s gotten used to. So I said, \u201cFocus on one thing at a time. First, focus on your career, on your business career. And when you\u2019re comfortable, and when you feel you have enough assets to sustain you, because politics is net out \u2013 for an honest person, in politics you spend more than you earn. So, I said I don\u2019t want you tempted, and I want to be sure that when you join, you\u2019re really there to help the country.,Be involved \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m telling him., Be involved, you don\u2019t have to join electoral politics, you don\u2019t have to run for a position, but be active, be involved, because it\u2019s your country, and you\u2019ve got to let your voice be heard.,I did say that that the Aquino administration and President Aquino himself was incompetent., I did say that but I gave examples of problems that could never be resolved. First was Terminal 1, being the worst airport in the world. Six years and they could not even solve that. They worse was the traffic situation in Metro Manila. Exacerbated in the middle of his administration, by the port congestion. Then the MRT not being able to maintain its trains properly and ran them on time, inconveniencing hundreds of thousands of commuters every day, every morning, every night, up to this day. Then you have other situations like the Mamasapano and the Yolanda. So it was one disaster, management disaster after another.,When Digong Duterte came in, and said, \u201cI can fix all that. I\u2019ll solve criminality, I\u2019ll solve corruption,\u201d people believed him because he had done in Davao.,I can\u2019t predict what will happen in the next six years,. I only know that the whole country is hopeful that Mayor Duterte or President-elect Duterte will able to resolve many of the problems that have been so intractable all these years. First is peace and order, particularly the drug problem. Second is general criminality. Third is corruption in the bureaucracy. You know when he gave the order that, \u201c,Hoy ,I want to see any applications approved in three days,\u201d that\u2019s what happens in Davao. First, he knows because he\u2019s done it already. And if he\u2019s able to do it, then everybody should be able to do it.,No, he can\u2019t eliminate crime in 3 to 6 months. ,That would be an exaggeration but if he just brings it down by 30 to 50 % within the next 3-6 months that will be a fantastic result. Then if he brings it down by 70% in the next 6 years, I think people are going to nominate him to be saint. In an election candidates do tend to exaggerate. And there\u2019s a reason for that. It is to create deeper contrast between what is and what should be. I\u2019m not saying that he\u2019s lying but I\u2019m saying he\u2019s trying to emphasize he is in a position and he has the political will to exercise what has to be done.,I will not be afraid to speak up. ,I think that we have to be careful that if we bring back the death penalty, we may be executing the innocent. So we don\u2019t want to show that we are barbaric, in order to be able to supress crime. What is important in our country is the certainty of punishment., Halimbawa, dito sa mga racketeering sino bang nabibilanggo dyan na mga mayayaman? Wala po.,But I will say this., You know that it was a very good bargaining tool for Mayor Duterte vis-\u00e0-vis the drug lords he\u2019s trying to supress or drive out from our society. So I won\u2019t begrudge him using that threat, but at the same time we\u2019re going to ask those who are for espousing the death penalty again, to prove that it is effective.,***,I\u2019ve been in the Senate for 18 years, three terms. ,And so my normal day would be I\u2019d go to sleep at around 2 in the morning and wake up at 8, six hours sleep. Then right away, well, first wash up and then read the newspapers. Have breakfast. Go to the internet. Look for the latest news here and abroad, especially abroad because I use the internet to read the newspapers, ,The New York Times,, ,Wall Street Journal,, find out what\u2019s going on. If we have a hearing I\u2019ll be there at 9 o\u2019clock. If we don\u2019t have hearings I\u2019d continue to read and study at home where it is quieter. And then I\u2019d go to the Senate about lunch time. And then in the Senate, there are appointments. People who want to see you. People who want to argue for and against a certain bill. We entertain them. And sessions begin at around 3 to 3:30. And after that I\u2019ll go back to my office and I wind up for the day. I leave my office at about 8 o\u2019clock at night. I\u2019ll be home by 9 depending upon traffic. Have dinner, take a shower. Then I\u2019d go back to reading and studying because I bring home about 3 or 4 bags of files to prepare for bills that will be taken up say in the next week. So that\u2019s a typical day. Very boring.,I remember something the late senator Soc Rodrigo once told me,. He said \u201cYou know, we are human beings so we feel we have to accomplish everything in our lifetimes.\u201d,We shouldn\u2019t think that way., We should try to contribute what we can during our lifetimes knowing that this work will never be finished and we must be able to train the younger generation to be able to take our places and go on and continue building and making a stronger country, during their lifetimes. And to remember that they too will have to live, will have to die and the next generation will take over.,People tend to listen more if you are a senator. ,But it also depends on what you\u2019re trying to say.,You have to believe that the generation that is to come will be better than your generation., You know when I first ran for the Senate, I was telling our friends that you know there must be around a hundred thousand Filipinos who would be better qualified to be senator than I, but if I\u2019m chosen then I\u2019ll have do the job. But believe me there are still a hundred thousand Filipinos out there who are make better senators than Serge Osmena.,Are the 24 senators who will be sitting in the next senate better qualified than Serge Osmena?, I think they all are. No exceptions.,I think every Filipino should involve themselves in politics., The moment that they stay away, that\u2019s the moment they allow the abuses to continue.,What I\u2019m worried about is that President Digong might not reach out enough beyond his immediate circle of Davao and Mindanao to pick the best and the brightest, ,for the positions that have to be run by professional managers. ,That\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of. He might limit himself to ,kung sinong kilala nya, sino magiging ,roommate ,nya,, ,sino magiging kaklase nya,, etc so we would have the same Noynoy Aquino syndrome again, and that will not be good for our country. There are many gifted Filipinos and he should really go out and have a real search for the best and the brightest, not because they were his classmates, but because they simply are recognized by sectors as being outstanding managers or outstanding thinkers, or outstanding policy-makers, and we\u2019d like to see that.,The Senate is an institution wherein the members can work or don\u2019t have to work. ,We don\u2019t have a party system. In other countries, the parties are the ones that watch you, and they have what they call the senate whip, and the house whip. ,Ito yung nag-aassign sa inyo ng, bills, house bills, ikaw ang bahala rito. ,Sa ating wala eh,. Zero. So, you can work if you want to work, or you can goof off if you want to goof off. And that\u2019s not good for our country because if you are elected, you\u2019re supposed to give it your all. And maybe I can say I tried to give it my all.,The Senate is an institution that will continue to do its job,, and that I\u2019m confident about.,I know that nation-building can continue, even if I\u2019m no longer a member of the senate, and I will continue to try to build this nation. ,I don't get emotionally attached to a job or to a building or to an office, no., ,I knew that it would end.,You have to understand what I\u2019ve been through,. I\u2019ve been uprooted. I had a nice, comfortable job as gentlemen farmer, then I was put in jail for five years, then I had to undertake an escape, then I had to live in exile for 14 years. So all of these things, these are nothing to me.,The sacrifices are always worth it. ,Especially if you can walk away and say, I did my best. I couldn\u2019t have accomplished a hundred percent, that was unrealistic, and I hope that whatever we left behind other people will build on, and continue the building until it reaches to the sky. We have to realize that we\u2019ll never be able to finish building that edifice. We can only contribute a few rocks to putting up that building, but others also have to come forward and contribute their share in building that edifice.,We are a society that is quite imperfect and I think we know that. But the thing is we don\u2019t know why. ,I'm trying to study now the why.,Are my children proud of me?, Well, you have to ask them. But I think that I can be assured myself that I\u2019m leaving them a good name. I always tell my children it takes a lifetime to build an honorable name and a good reputation, and it can be torn down in a few seconds. So, you always have to be very watchful. And I may not be able to give you much money, but I want to leave you a good name.,I think you\u2019re asking somebody what he wants his epitaph to be. ,I want to be remembered as a decent man. A man who made sacrifices for his country a man who tried to do his best every step of the way, a man who never surrendered or buckled down in his principles and a man who loved this country. ,I never have thought of retiring., I will retire when I die,. ,\u2013 ,Rappler.com, , , , , , , , , , , ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/138019-last-session-serge-osmena", "title": "The last session: Serge Osme\u00f1a leaves the building"},

The next thing residents knew, waves as high as 30 meters came rushing to the city, carrying with them houses, cars, trees, and drowning thousands of people.,The quake also destroyed a number of nuclear reactors in the country, causing fear and panic to millions of people due to the threat of radiation.,On that day, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) was able to monitor the formation of the tsunami through its tide tools \u2013 a software that enables experts to view the sea-levels in various parts of the world, including the Pacific Ocean.,\u201cWe noticed that (the) Funatu City tide gauge suddenly rose and got destroyed. It leveled up. It just became horizontal, meaning the tide gauge was destroyed,\u201d Phivolcs director Renato Solidum said.,This prompted the agency to raise Tsunami Alert Level 2, warning residents near the coasts about tsunami with waves as high as one meter.,Solidum said that although the tsunami was generated in the Pacific Ocean, it did not heavily damage the Philippines because the Japan trench, the fault that generated the earthquake, is not parallel to the Philippines.,Solidum compares this to dropping an object on water. \"If you drop a pebble on the water you will see a circular ripple. But the fault is not a small point. A fault is a line so instead of a pebble, why don\u2019t we drop a long 2x2 piece of wood?\",Dropping is the reverse of uplift, Solidum explained. \"So if you drop that wood, you would notice that the highest splash or wave that would generate would be perpendicular to the length of the fault.\u201d,He said that because the Philippine coastline was not facing the Japan Trench, the waves were not high. The highest tsunami that reached the Philippines at the time was less than a meter. This was recorded in Catanduanes.,Due to the strength of the earthquake, experts ,said, that the earth\u2019s axis shifted for about 4 inches, causing days to be shorter by 1.8 microseconds.,The 2011 Sendai earthquake was the strongest to hit Japan since 1900, and the fourth strongest in the world. It killed around ,15,800 people, and cost $200 billion worth of damage.,If an earthquake of the same magnitude occurred in a location parallel to the Philippines, we could also experience a devastating tsunami. Are you prepared?,Here are some basic information on tsunamis.,WHAT IS A TSUNAMI?, ,A tsunami is a series of sea waves commonly generated by under-the-sea earthquakes, with heights that could be greater than 5 meters.,In the Philippines, it occurs when the earthquake is at least magnitude 6.5 and is shallow-seated, meaning the epicenter is less than 30 km below the seafloor.,Oftentimes, it is mistakenly associated with storm surges, tall waves that are caused by typhoons passing through seas and oceans. (READ: ,Storm Surges 101: Are you at risk? Are you prepared for it?,),Volcanic eruptions and landslides may also cause tsunamis.,TYPES OF TSUNAMIS, ,When an under-the-sea earthquake occurs within the Philippines\u2019 earthquake generators. It takes 2-20 minutes before the waves reach the shores of affected areas., ,Distant or far field,When an under-the-sea earthquake occurs outside the Philippines or in the Pacific Ocean and generates a tsunami. Depending on the location, this has a longer lead time., ,How vulnerable is the Philippines?,The Philippines\u2019 location makes it vulnerable to tsunamis. Being an archipelago along the Pacific Ocean\u2019s Ring of Fire, it is surrounded by both bodies of water and trenches such as the following:,Metro Manila, the country\u2019s capital is also vulnerable to tsunamis because it faces the Manila Bay. In the past, two tsunamis with heights of 1-2 meters, affected the bay in 1828 and 1863.,Affected areas were Manila, Bataan, Zambales, Cavite, Batangas, and Mindoro which face the Manila Trench, the source of the tsunami in this part of the Philippines, Solidum explained.,On record, at least 3 distant tsunamis have also affected the country in the past. These were the ,1960 Great Chilean Earthquake, \u2013 magnitude 9.5, the 2010 Chile Earthquake \u2013 magnitude 8.8, and the 2011 Sendai Earthquake in Japan.,Community-based preparedness,To prepare for the occurence of tsunamis in the country, Phivolcs has initiated various tsunami warning and preparedness projects.,Unknown to many, the December 2004 tsunami had a big and positive impact on the Philippines,Through funding from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) in 2006, it was able to develop a tsunami detection system by setting up dry and wet sensors in 10 sites all over the Philippines. It also allowed the agency to produce ,tsunami hazard maps, in coastal areas.,In 2013, the Phivolcs released different comics, based on real stories of Filipino survivors of the 2011 Sendai earthquake. These were written in Filipino.,But while these projects can really be helpful to Filipinos, Solidum has always emphasized the importance of community-based preparedness, especially during locally-generated tsunamis.,The locals, he said, should not only rely on warnings and advice but on the use of natural observances as well.,\u201cIn our experiences and observations, 2-5 minutes ,may mga events na nandiyan na yung, tsunami after the earthquake (there are events when the tsunami comes after the earthquake). So in that case, there is very limited time to give warning. The locals should know the safe places to go and evacuate,\u201d Solidum said. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Sources: Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, ,National Police Agency of Japan,, ,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,, ,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,, various news websites", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/knowledge-base/86509-tsunami-101-need-know-tsunamis", "title": "Tsunami 101: What you need to know about tsunamis"},

Located along the Pacific Ocean\u2019s \u201cRing of Fire\u201d and having 5 major fault lines, it is vulnerable to disasters such as earthquakes.,The country is no stranger to earthquakes, but one of the most memorable to hit it is the quake that hit the island of Luzon in 1990. That powerful quake resulted in a number of collapsed buildings and thousands of lives lost. ,At around 4 pm on July 16, 1990, a magnitude-7.8 earthquake hit Northern and Central Luzon. Its epicenter was recorded in Nueva Ecija, and the shaking lasted for about a minute.,Among the hardest hit areas were the cities of Baguio, Cabanatuan in Nueva Ecija, and Dagupan in Pangasinan. ,In Baguio City, several structures collapsed, burying people alive. Some establishments destroyed included hotels like the Hyatt Terraces Plaza, Nevada Hotel, Baguio Hilltop Hotel, Baguio Park Hotel, and FRB Hotel. ,Because of shocks and fear of possible aftershocks, thousands of residents slept on the streets.,The quake left an estimated US$369-million worth of damages, and a total of 2,412 people dead.,Lessons,The 1990 earthquake left not just massive damage and casualties, but also lessons about disaster readiness.,Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) Director Renato Solidum said the great earthquake left us with 4 valuable lessons.,According to Solidum, not much attention was given to disasters, especially earthquakes, at the time. In fact, earthquake drills were unheard of then.,Fortunately, earthquake drills are often conducted lately. This is in anticipation of a 7.2-magnitude earthquake that could be produced by the movement of the West Valley Fault, and of a tsunami that could result from the movement of the Manila Trench. (READ: ,#MMShakeDrill: Metro-Wide Earthquake Drill 2017,),After the earthquake, transportation and communication lines were all affected, leaving Baguio isolated from the outside. The government did not have any idea about what the situation in Baguio was like then. ,Taking off from that, Solidum said it is important for people to be aware of the hazards in their areas so that if a disaster happens, they are not left clueless about developments \u2013 should communication lines be cut or roads blocked. ,Despite having sevral collapsed and destroyed buildings, a good number of them were left standing then. Solidum said the country's building code is actually good, but the problem lies in implementation. Good design, quality materials, and good workmanship are needed for a disaster-resilient building. ,When it comes to land use planning, he said that buildings should not be constructed in areas prone to landslides. \u201cShaking does not kill people. Collapsing buildings will,\u201d Solidum said.,Immediate response after an earthquake could be a problem, especially if there is a lack of rescue groups and responders.,According to Solidum, the golden rule is: \"People must be rescued within the first 3 days.\" ,But are we ready? ,In 2004, a study funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, ,the ,Metro Manila Earthquake Impact Reduction Study (MMEIRS), found, that a 7.2 magnitude earthquake could hit Metro Manila and could destroy 40% of the establishments in the metropolis and kill around 34,000.,Have we learned from the lessons left by the 1990 earthquake?

And the theory behind storm surges is extensively studied in one work.\n,HISTORY LESSONS. All images courtesy of the Emilia A. Lotilla Book Collection,MANILA, Philippines - By now, a number of us would have come across accounts of a terrible typhoon that swept central Philippines 116 years and barely a month to the day of Yolanda\u2019s (Haiyan's) destructive visit.,Until I scanned quickly through the scientific study published by Fr. Jose Algue, S.J. of the Observatorio de Manila, and entitled \u201cEl Baguio de Samar y Leyte, 12-13 de Octubre 1897,\u201d I did not realize the full significance of the storm surge that devastated practically the same region that Yolanda did.,Fr. Algue and his team from the Observatory, having received in Manila the report from the Capitan del Puerto de Tacloban only on October 20 of the events of October 12 and 13, 1897, decided to conduct an ocular inspection of the affected areas to verify details of, among others, \u201cgrandes movimientos\u201d in the seas, with extraordinary storm surges and inundation of coasts, total destruction of towns and even disappearance of islands and deformation of coasts.,Similarities,The typhoon of October 1897 had similarities with Yolanda in terms of its path: it landed very near Guiuan in Samar, proceeded to Tanauan, Palo and Tacloban in Leyte, struck northern Cebu and northern Panay (then the province of Capiz which included the present-day province of Aklan) and exited just south of Mindoro island. (See general map),The similarity does not end there: a storm surge or \u201cola de huracan\u201d laid low everything in its path. Perhaps comparable to Yolanda, the height of the storm surge reached more than 7 meters in some places. In Tanauan, 5 meters; in the Tacloban peninsula where the airport now stands at around 3.9 meters and on the other side of Tacloban close to San Juanico Straight, 4.5 meters.,In Vasey (now Basey) Samar, it was estimated at 4.9 meters, and between Marabut and Lawa-an in what is now Eastern Samar, at 5 meters. Hernani on the eastern Samar coast experienced a storm surge of 7.3 meters. (See detailed maps of Leyte and Samar areas).,The theory surrounding storm surges is extensively discussed in the work. Of note is the observation that \u201clos baguios\u201d are accompanied by a considerable rise in sea levels called \u201cola del huracan\u201d and traced to the same cause that results in a significant lowering of barometric readings.,It admits that the name \u201cOla del huracan\u201d is not entirely accurate in describing the nature and characteristics of that mountain  or mass of water (\u201cmonta\u00f1a o masa de agua\u201d) which accompanies a storm\u2019s vortex, but it is a term which has been used by Spanish mariners since ancient times.,An even more extensive discussion of the different meteorological phenomena of the typhoon as it passed through the archipelago is included in the Algue work. The barometric readings from various parts of the country are recorded and explained, accompanied by pictures and sketches of the extent of the devastation.,The number of fatalities are summarized as follows: In Samar\u2014Quinapundan 12, Hernani 166, Salcedo 44, Mercedes 5, Guiuan 94, Balangiga 27, Vasey 500 (approximate). In Leyte: Tacloban 200 (probably more than less), Visita de San Joaquin 11, and the rest of Leyte 240 (approximate). Approximate total for both islands: 1299. Just for comparison, at that time, Hernani had 4000 inhabitants and Palo in Leyte had a total population of around 14,000.,The pictures speak for themselves. The communities and churches of Samar and Leyte, including Guiuan, Tacloban and Palo were destroyed in 1897.,Hope after devastation,For me, their most eloquent unspoken message for us today is one of hope: these communities did live again; and they will once more.,In rebuilding and reconstruction, however, it is best to plan with the safety of the population and critical infrastructure foremost in mind. ,The observations of the Capitan del Puerto de Tacloban who almost lost his life in 1897 are worthy: The ola del huracan entered Tacloban at the opening of the bay of San Pedro and San Pablo, converged with the waters of San Juanico Strait and of the Port.,Aggravating the elevated waters were the surrounding mountains found on all sides except for the part where the town is located, which is not more than a tongue of low-lying land. Since this was the only available exit for the waters, understandably they attained such considerable height and theinundation was the principal cause of the fatalities.,The October 1897 typhoon was considered, based on the energy of its internal or cyclonic movement, among the most violent that traversed the Philippine archipelago. As indicated by barometric readings, it was 5 times greater than the famous typhoon of October 1882 which tracked the southern part of Luzon. Based on its accompanying storm surge and the havoc caused, it was considered as entirely extraordinary.,Until Yolanda, that is.,With the growing frequency and easing intensity of extreme events, we need to increase the resiliency of our people and communities through deliberate planning and action in the course of rehabilitation and rebuilding.,History in Samar and Leyte provides us lessons. Together, we must act intelligently on them. - ,Rappler.com,(The author is a former energy secretary.

Ilocos Norte 1st District Representative Rodolfo Fari\u00f1as leads the probe into the alleged misuse of tobacco funds under Governor Imee Marcos.  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The spotlight is on Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos, who is being accused of misusing the province\u2019s tobacco funds to purchase motor vehicles. ,This is the subject of an ongoing House probe initiated by no less than her political rival, Ilocos Norte 1st District Representative and Majority Leader Rodolfo Fari\u00f1as together with two of his deputies \u2013 Pampanga 3rd District Representative Aurelio Gonzales Jr and Pampanga 4th District Representative Juan Pablo Bondoc.,Fari\u00f1as, former Ilocos Norte governor, showed copies of documents indicating P66.45-million worth of tobacco funds were used for the following:,The tobacco fund was created through Republic Act Number 7171, which mandates 15% of tobacco excise taxes shall be allotted for a special support fund for tobacco farmers in the identified provinces, mostly in the Ilocos region.

But the House committee on good government and public accountability\u2019s investigation has so far raised several red flags in the purchases. ,Rappler also obtained documents indicating another ,P57.5 million ,of the tobacco funds was used for Marcos\u2019 pet project, Programang Ikauunlad ng Mamamayan Ekonomiya at Ekolohiya, or what local officials call \u201cP Imee.\u201d ,Missing original documents,HARD-HITTING QUESTIONS. Majority Leader Rodolfo Fari\u00f1as leads the grilling of resource persons during the investigation. Photo by Jasmin Dulay/Rappler  ,Information about the transactions was, first relayed to Fari\u00f1as, by barangay captains in his district. They said they were issued mini-cabs that did not have documents, leading to further problems.  ,\"So nasisita sila, nahuhuli ng LTO (Land Transportation Office) dahil wala namang registration. Ang kanilang more urgent concern is sila ang nag-aabono sa fuel and oil ng mga vehicles (So the LTO apprehends them because they do not have registration. Their urgent concern is that they are the ones paying for the fuel and oil of the vehicles) because they could not use their budget in the barangay because these vehicles are not booked or documented as owned by the barangays,,\" Fari\u00f1as said.,He was able to secure copies of the purchase requests, obligation requests, disbursement vouchers, and checks used to buy the vehicles. But he said the original documents, stored at the Ilocos Norte capitol, disappeared ever since they initiated the probe.  ,\u201cAs soon as the resolution was filed for the investigation of these transactions, all the documents relating thereto were stolen from the COA office at the provincial capitol, and all the offices of the provincial treasurer, accountant, budget officer and development coordinator have destroyed all their files,\u201d said Fari\u00f1as.,This was backed by Marilyn Llaguno, Commission on Audit (COA) supervising auditor for Ilocos who had audited the transactions made by the provincial government at the time. ,Under oath, Llaguno told lawmakers during the first hearing on May 2 that she could not find the disbursement vouchers that were supposedly placed inside the document store room at the capitol. ,COA audit team leader Vicenta dela Cruz then requested other copies of the said documents from provincial accountant Eden Battulayan and bids and awards committee chairperson Pedro Agcaoili. ,Both Battulayan and Agcaoili wrote to Dela Cruz saying the originals of the documents were no longer in their custody because they were submitted to COA for post-auditing. ,In a separate hearing, COA Chairman Michael Aguinaldo testified that only the documents relating to the purchase of the mini-cabs, secondhand buses, and Foton mini trucks were missing.,With only copies of the original documents available, can the House still push through with the investigation? Rule 128 of the Rules of Court says yes.,Section 5 states: \u201cWhen the original document has been lost or destroyed, or cannot be produced in court, the offeror, upon proof of its execution or existence and the cause of its unavailability without bad faith on his part, may prove its contents by a copy, or by a recital of its contents in some authentic document, or by the testimony of witnesses in the order stated.\",Cornelio Viernos, a member of the team who audited the transactions for the secondhand buses and mini trucks, also testified during the investigation that Fari\u00f1as\u2019 copies of the documents contained the same information as the original ones given to COA for post-auditing. ,Cash advances used to pay for vehicles,Ilocos Norte bought the 40 mini-cabs, 5 secondhand buses, and 70 Foton mini trucks through cash advances, a violation of COA Circular 92-382 which states that all disbursements by local government units should be made in checks, except in certain cases. ,The document, issued on July 3, 1992, details the rules and regulations on accounting and auditing rules, pursuant to the Local Government Code of 1991.  ,Cash advances are only allowed in the following cases:,Rappler obtained a copy of an Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) issued by COA supervising auditor Rizalino Franco Jr to Marcos on January 8, 2013.,In the AOM, Rizalino identified the purchase of the 5 secondhand buses and 70 Foton mini trucks in 2012 as among the cash advances \u201cnot in accordance to the provisions of COA Circular 92-382.\u201d,\u201cWe recommend that management should strictly observe rules and regulations on the proper granting of cash advances,\u201d wrote Rizalino.,Checks issued ahead of bidding process completion,Documents from COA and the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (Philgeps) also show that Marcos authorized the release of money ahead of the completion of the bidding processes for the motor vehicles.,These documents were also submitted as evidence to the House committee on good government and public accountability. ,The notice to bid for the secondhand buses \u2013 worth P15.3 million \u2013 was posted on May 24, 2012 in Philgeps. The Ilocos Norte provincial government gave interested bidders until June 14, 2012 to purchase the bidding documents. ,But on the same day the notice to bid was published on Philgeps, Battulayan, Marcos, and provincial treasurer Calajate already signed a disbursement voucher authorizing the release of P15.3 million to buy 5 secondhand buses.,The check was immediately issued the next day, signed by Calajate, Marcos, and Genedine Jambaro from the Provincial Treasurer\u2019s Office. This means the Ilocos Norte provincial government already authorized the release of P15.3 million even while the bidding process was still ongoing. ,The same situation occurred for the purchase of 70 Foton mini trucks worth P32,550,000.,The notice for direct contracting for the mini trucks was posted on Philgeps on September 12, 2012. Battulayan, Calajate, and Marcos signed the disbursement voucher for the release of P32,550,000 on the same day. A check for the transaction was also issued on September 12, 2012. ,As for the 40 mini-cabs worth P18.6 million, Philgeps deputy executive director Maria Rosa Clemente told lawmakers they have no record of the bidding process for it in their system. ,Ilocos Norte executives refusing to talk,DETAINED OFFICIALS.

They then asked the committee if they could see the original copies so they could properly comment. ,Fari\u00f1as had asked Jambaro if she remembers signing a check worth P15.3 million for the secondhand buses. ,Jambaro replied: \",Your honor, 'di ko na talagang maalala sa dami ng transactions sa amin, (Your honor, I really can't remember because of the number of transactions we have).\" ,Gaor gave a similar answer when Fari\u00f1as asked her if she signed a cash advance for the purchase of mini-cabs. ,\"That was the exact same testimony given by [Jambaro]... ,Walang maniniwala sa 'yo, (No one will believe you),\" said a laughing Fari\u00f1as.,The House panel then unanimously agreed to cite all 6 officials in contempt.

Mayon Volcano has erupted nearly 50 times since its first recorded explosion in 1616. Photo by Naoki Mengua/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines - Exactly 201 years ago today, on February 1, 1814, the people of Albay witnessed Mayon Volcano\u2019s most destructive eruption yet. The eruption killed roughly 1,200 people.,Mayon demonstrated a Plinian blast, the largest and most violent type of eruption, that partly destroyed the historical Cagsawa church in lahar. The church is about 10 km (6 miles) away from the volcano.,Plinian-type eruptions, can produce ash falls, lava bombs, volcanic rocks miles away from a volcano. This is also the type of explosion that Mt. Pinatubo exhibited in its most destructive blast, one of the ,worst natural disasters, in the country, in 1991.,The 1814 eruption is the \u201cmost destructive in terms of casualties and the distance that the volcanic hazards reached from the crater,\u201d says the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) director Renato Solidum.,Solidum explained that while the eruption lasted only for one day, Mayon emitted large amounts of material during that short period. After the eruption, rains combined with volcanic ash producing lahar which flowed down the rivers and partly buried the distant church.,According to Solidum, from the analysis of PHIVOLCS, there were also pyroclastic flows that went down the slopes of Mayon and buried many areas in Albay during this particular eruption. Pyroclastic flows are dense mixtures of hot, dry rock fragments and hot gases.,Other notable eruptions,World renowned for its almost perfect cone shape, Mayon is the country\u2019s most active volcano according to Solidum. Albay\u2019s ,Daragang Magayon, (Bicolano words for \"beautiful lady\") \u2013 is very temperamental. It has erupted nearly 50 times since its first recorded explosion in 1616. Those eruptions caused untold destruction and claimed many lives.,Below is a list of some of the notable eruptions of Mayon. These are mostly ,Vulcanian-type eruptions, which are relatively small but violent explosions of thick lava producing columns of ash, gas and occasional pyroclastic flows.,1766 July 20-24,: The second recorded eruption of Mayon was a Vulcanian-type of explosion. Pyroclastic and lava flows destroyed the town of Malinao and produced major damages in Cagsawa, Guinobatan, Budiao, Polangui, Ligao killing ,39 people,.,1853 July 7,: Mayon had another Vulcanian-type eruption with ashfall, lava bombs and pyroclastic flows that caused ,34 casualties,.,1897 June 4 - July 23,: The second most destructive eruption of Mayon featured a violent phase that lasted for 17 hours. It was a strong Vulcanian blast that killed ,350 people, due to pyroclastic flows in the seashore of the municipality of Sto. Domingo in Albay.,1993 Feb. 2 - Apr. 4,: The eruption ,killed 77, and injured 5 people due to pyroclastic flow and lava flow and lahar that were confined to gullies, landforms created by running water.,2013 May 6,: A sudden ,phreatic explosion,, a ,steam eruption without lava emission,,killed 5 ,and hurt 7 hikers.,#ZeroCasualty in Albay,Living with a highly active volcano and having to cope with strong typhoons almost every year has taught the people of Albay one very important lesson: disaster preparedness is very important.,The province boasts of a zero casualty record from disasters in 18 of the past 20 years. Preparation and adaptation is key to this success, Albay Governor Joey Salceda says,.  (READ: ,Salceda: Funds for climate mitigation hard to get,),A ,permanent danger zone, consisting areas 6 kilometers from the volcano was delineated and constantly observed. Sudden gas driven explosion may take place in these areas that could cause serious injury and death.,One incident that caused casualties was when a typhoon occurred after Mayon volcano exploded in 2006. A total of 1,399 people were killed in Bicol region including the province of Albay that year. Casualties were caused by the flood from Typhoon Reming (international name Durian), which hit the province months after the explosion, intensified by the lahar from the volcano.,Because of the disaster in 2006, the local government of Albay has ,learned its lessons,. \"I cannot remove Mayon volcano, I cannot stop typhoons, and people won't move. We have to live and adapt with those factors,\" Salceda said. ,Thus, on September 16, 2014, when Mayon showed signs of potential eruption, ,Salceda declared a ,state of calamity,  in areas surrounding Mayon Volcano.,Inhabitants within the permanent ,danger zone, and in the extended danger zone (areas 6-8 kilometers from the volcano) were ,evacuated, immediately.,On December 19, 2014, the PHIVOLCS, observing a  \u201cgeneral decline\u201d in the volcano\u2019s activity,, lowered the alert status for Mayon,. By that time, the provincial government has already shouldered expenses to evacuate some 3,000 families for roughly 3 months. The expense was well worth it, however, as far as as the local government is concerned.

Pacquiao\u2019s promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank got his first look at him in December, when he knocked out veteran Ali Funeka in 6 rounds on the undercard of the WBO heavyweight title fight between Joe Parker and Andy Ruiz Jr in New Zealand., ,Pacquiao, 38, says the fight has not yet been finalized, revealing that promoters are still working out the venue for the fight, which is expected to take place April 23., ,\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the finalization within two weeks from now,\u201d said Pacquiao, who last defeated Jessie Vargas in November., ,\u201cOnce we get a venue, we\u2019ll confirm an opponent. So there\u2019s nothing definite on either a venue or an opponent,\u201d added Pacquiao\u2019s adviser Michael Koncz, who said the next fight could land in Australia or in the United Arab Emirates cities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai., ,\"W,hy do you need an opponent if you don\u2019t have a venue? The venue\u2019s the priority right now,\" Koncz said.,Even though Horn would be Pacquiao\u2019s first opponent in 10 years who wasn\u2019t a current or former world champion, Koncz says there is still need for caution in approaching any fighter., ,\u201cEvery opponent is a dangerous opponent at this time in Manny\u2019s career because you don\u2019t know when he\u2019s gonna get old. If you put it on paper and compare it to Manny\u2019s schedule, it doesn\u2019t match. But again, you can\u2019t just go by what\u2019s on the paper,\u201d said Koncz, who likewise had not previously heard of Horn, the WBO's number-two-ranked welterweight.,(READ: ,Jeff Horn: I can beat Manny Pacquiao,),Pacquiao also shot down ,Arum\u2019s plan to have him fight 4 times in 2017,, with a fight to follow in July, in September, and another at the end of the year as a farewell bout against Terence Crawford, the unbeaten unified junior welterweight champion., ,\u201cI\u2019m not a robot. I\u2019m human. To fight twice a year is hard for me, how much if I fight 4 times a year? It\u2019s gonna be impossible,\u201d said Pacquiao, an 8-division champion who has been professional for 21 years., ,Koncz added that that schedule wouldn\u2019t work with Pacquiao\u2019s schedule in the Senate, saying his second fight of the year would take place in October or November, depending on when he has a break.,\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely not true, maximum we\u2019ll fight is two times,\u201d said Koncz. \u201cThat\u2019s just Arum doing wishful thinking on a possible tour.\u201d, ,Koncz says that the plan is to fight twice in 2017, then have another fight or two in 2018 before deciding whether or not to continue his career. Pacquiao isn\u2019t expected to be in the boxing gym until 6 or 7 weeks before the fight, and his camp says they aren\u2019t yet concerned about who their opponent will be for the end of the year bout., ,\u201cAt this stage in Manny\u2019s career, we don\u2019t have a whole big list to pick from. [Floyd Mayweather Jr] is happily retired so we wish him the best of luck. We\u2019ll just worry about this fight and then worry about the next one when November comes,\u201d said Koncz., ,When asked about the WBC/WBA welterweight unification bout between undefeated titleholders Danny Garcia and Keith Thurman set for March 3 in Brooklyn, New York, Pacquiao picked Garcia to win. He says he\u2019d take a fight against the winner if offered.,\u201cI\u2019m ready to fight anybody,\u201d said Pacquiao. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,Ryan Songalia is the sports editor of Rappler, a member of the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) and a contributor to The Ring magazine.

A banker of 37 years who worked in 3 continents, he has been training with Dr Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives.,Together, they have written two books: ,Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality ,and ,I,mported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons.,Hi Dr Holmes and Mr Baer,, ,Good day! This is Josh, 24 years old, from Manila. I have some questions for you. When I watch porn videos, I envy those boys who have big dicks, and believe it or not, I want to achieve that too. Is it okay to drink penis enlargement tablets? Is it safe? And will I experience side effects when I do it? Before, what I did is the natural way, which is \",jelqing,,\" but I stopped. What is the safest and surest way to achieve a big package for a man like me?,Thank you very much and more power! ,Regards,, Josh,-----------,Dear Josh,, ,Thank you for your email., ,The male belief that he is inadequately endowed in the penis department and the consequent desire for enhancement seems to have been a concern for thousands of years. Many treatments have been promoted over time, but the fact is that most have been either ineffective or fraudulent, or both. Science has not unequivocally endorsed a single non-surgical option, which perhaps ought to lead us to believe that while further research may possibly produce a \"cure,\" in the meantime, except in extreme cases, we must simply make the best of what we have. For those interested in a more comprehensive view, please see, this article from, BJUI,,, formerly known as the ,British Journal of Urology,.,Why is penis size so important? The penis has of course been a symbol of masculinity since prehistoric times and the correlation between penis size on the one hand and power and strength on the other continues to influence our lives today. Early man and woman prized strength and size for practical reasons, since much work was manual and possessions (which then included women) required physical protection. When one adds to the mix the correlation between physical attributes and sexual success, it is understandable that body image, in general, and penis size in particular, became issues.,This mindset has persisted despite the industrial revolution and in modern times has been exacerbated by the media and the internet, which have, first, promoted unrealistic body ideals; and second, made porn (and thus comparisons beyond the borders of most people\u2019s experiences) so pervasively available. This mindset has also persisted despite considerable evidence that most (though not all) women do not consider that bigger is better. In general, they value technique over size and the security of a relationship over a casual encounter.,Against this background, what are men\u2019s reasons for wanting bigger penises? There seems to be a number of different possibilities. Firstly, and least likely, it is job-related \u2013 eg they wish to be porn stars and need the appropriate equipment. Secondly, they have penises that are small by any standard. Thirdly, they have been criticized by a partner for the size of and/or their performance with their penis. Fourthly, they are simply convinced that a bigger penis will make them more attractive, more self-confident and more successful, or at least less unattractive, less insecure, and less unsuccessful, in the sexual arena.,Those like you, Josh, who appear to fall into this last category often seem to be totally deaf to the outside world. After all, your plans for this penis involve a partner in an activity \u2013 sex \u2013 in which two, not one, players have their separate roles, their separate likes and dislikes, their separate fantasies, et cetera. Yet you are taking no account of this at all. What if your future partner does not relish the thought, much less the actual experience, of a humongous penis?,Your approach seems similar to that of a chef who wants to create a special meal to woo an unidentified potential lover and is dead set on choosing the dishes now. What are his chances of success with no input from his guest? Choosing the menu before knowing who the guest will be is scarcely guaranteeing success. Not everyone wants to be courted with a huge steak, after all. Some prefer something a little subtler, for example, or are vegetarians., ,All of this seems to militate against trying to upsize. Instead, forget the big picture, find yourself a real partner, and set about building a deep and meaningful relationship that centers around what that particular person wants. ,All the best,,JAF Baer, ,Illustration by Nico Villarete  ,Dear Josh,,Thank you very much for your letter. Mr Baer has written what I feel (hopefully accurately and with no bias whatsoever ,\u263a, ) is one of THE best answers to questions about penis size that I have ever read, weaving history, philosophy, science, correct \u2013 as opposed to false \u2013 analogy, and humor.  ,Thus, I am limiting my contribution to information regarding the possibilities of increasing penis size both from scientific journals and from, one website, which, albeit obviously wanting money more than anything else, might be worth a look if one were desperate for what it offers (which I am not sure it can deliver). But you are a man of 24, so, in the end, despite my fervent wish that you do NOT fall for this claptrap, here is the information so you can decide for yourself.,One of their leading advisers and, in fact, the only one they seem truly proud of  is \u201cDr ,Howard II,\u201d a male enhancement expert who personally gained 3 inches in length and two inches in girth.,Is it just me or do you also feel his credibility is not necessarily enhanced by knowing exactly how many inches his penis (supposedly) got longer and chubbier?,I read about 20 scientific journals on penile lengthening, but the ones I found most helpful were the following:,In \u201c,Non-invasive methods of penile lengthening: fact or fiction?,\u201d authors Marco Oderda and Paolo Gontero say the efficacy of penile traction for patients seeking a penile lengthening procedure is supported by (some) scientific evidence. There are a few more studies about penile extenders., ,The general consensus is that these devices can produce durable lengthening of the penis, anywhere ranging from +.5 cm to +3.1 cm, depending on the actual product used (from Spain, the States) and also on the number of hours they have to be attached during the day (for as long as 6 hours, in many cases). Personally, wearing something that stretches one\u2019s penis while you\u2019re working, sleeping, eating(!!) sounds utterly painful and so not worth it, but perhaps the fact that I do not have a penis I want lengthened has a lot to do with it., ,By the way, these extenders are effective mainly for length, not for girth., ,Other devices to increase penis size include penoscrotal rings and the injection of botulinum toxin.,Penile lengthening exercises have no scientific evidence to back up their claims but many men seem encouraged by the idea of a non-invasive, low-cost method of having their penis enlarged. By way of example, if you search Google for the combination \"penile lengthening exercise,\" you will find over 40,000 entries.,So there you have it, Josh. Mr Baer\u2019s and my answers to your question. In all candor, I feel Mr Baer\u2019s response is the much more helpful one. However, because we also like to respond to the readers\u2019 expressed needs and not just what we feel he should need, we decided to add my bit. We hoped we\u2019ve helped, and should you need anything more from us, please write again. We also hope that, should you decide to try any of the methods mentioned above, you write to us and share your experience so others may benefit from it. , All the best,,MG Holmes,Need advice from our Two Pronged duo?

This photo taken on Oct 15, 2012 shows members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) shouting 'Allahu Akbar' (God is Great) during a celebration inside camp Darapanan in Sultan Kudarat town in Mindanao, to coincide with the signing of the Framework Agreement. Photo by Karlos Manlupig/AFP,KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (5th UPDATE) \u2013 The 16-year peace talks between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) can soon move away from the negotiating table towards ground implementation.,Both sides on Saturday, January 25, agreed on a historic firearms deal that would require the rebel group to gradually decommission their firearms in phases. ,It is the last document needed to be settled before the comprehensive peace agreement can be signed. Earlier, the panels signed annexes on ,transition,, ,wealth-sharing, and ,power-sharing.,They also signed an agreement on ,water territories, \u2013 an issue left hanging when the panels signed the power-sharing annex in December 2013. ,Before the actual signing of the agreement, members of the MILF panel were in a caucus with lawmakers. ,Under the annex on normalization, the MILF agreed to \"decommission\" a specific number of their firearms and troops in certain periods as the government, in exchange, also gave its commitment to reduce armed forces and help disband private armed groups in Mindanao., ,Ladies and gentlemen, we have an \nAgreement!,The MILF, however, said they will not \"surrender\" their firearms to the government. Instead, a third-party group will handle the inventory of MILF firearms and their troops. Ahead of the signing, government peace panel member Yasmin Busran-Lao told reporters an Independent Decommissioning Body (IDB) that will recommend the most appropriate mechanism on how to store the arms will be created after the signing. ,\"For peace, real peace in Mindanao, we have to decommission our forces. There is no element of surrender,\" Iqbal said.,Both Iqbal and ,government peace panel chair Miriam Coronel-Ferrer declined to give estimates on the number of arms and troops that will be decommissioned. ,The deal is different compared to the 1996 peace pact between the government and MILF's rival group, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which did not require MNLF troops to lay down their firearms. ,Both sides also agreed to design socio-economic programs for MILF troops who will no longer engage in war, as transitional justice mechanisms are put in place. ,Once the comprehensive peace agreement is signed, MILF chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal earlier said the MILF will stop using its arms and start its transformation towards becoming a \"social movement.\" (READ: ,What happens to MILF after peace deal?,),CELEBRATION. The celebratory mood of members of the Philippine panel says it all. Photo by Angela Casauay/Rappler,Next battle: Congress,In October 2012, both parties signed the ,Framework Agreement,, which outlines the roadmap towards the creation of the Bangsamoro political entity set to replace the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). ,The ,new government will be ministerial in form,, with members elected by the people who will choose a chief minister among themselves. It will enjoy ,automatic appropriations, \u2013 similar to the internal revenue allotment of local government units \u2013 with a 75% share in taxes and revenues from metallic minerals.,Although the parties are expected to sign a final peace pact soon, more work lies ahead. ,\",It marks the end of a process, which is the formal negotiations - the effective end, of course, with some more finishing touches necessary but it also marks the challenge of a bigger challenge ahead, which is the challenge of implementation,\" ,Ferrer said.,After more than a year of hard work, the peace panel in a moment of joy! Congrats to Sec Ging and d peace panel. ,pic.twitter.com/pUnBwHt9Ir,In a statement, Secretary Teresita Quintos Deles of the Office of the ,Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process said, \"It has been a very difficult road arriving at this major milestone of the peace process.\" The crafting of agreements underwent \"painstaking deliberation by the two parties, backed up by thorough discussion and internal consensus-building on each side of the negotiating table, and grounded on extensive consultations with concerned local government units, religious and civil society leaders, and communities especially in the conflict-affected areas.\",Annex on Normalization signed by the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front,But the signing of the peace agreement is only the first phase towards the creation of a new government that both sides hope would foster lasting peace in Mindanao. The next battleground is Congress. ,After the signing of the peace pact, the 15-member Bangsamoro Transition Commission will go full blast in crafting the Basic Law that will provide the legal framework for the creation of the new political entity. ,The proposed law will then be submitted to Congress and be certified urgent by the President. Iqbal said the commission has set an April deadline for the completion of the bill. ,Challenges,Deles acknowledged the challenges that lie ahead. She said, \"It has been a difficult road getting to here and we know that the path ahead will continue to be fraught with challenges. As we celebrate this moment, we also affirm our readiness to undertake the tasks that shall ensure the full and satisfactory implementation of this agreement...\",North Cotabato Representative Jesus Sacdalan, vice chairman of the House committee on peace, justice and reconciliation, said Congress may have time to discuss the measure when it resumes session from May 5 to June 13, before adjourning the first regular session. Sacdalan, along with other lawmakers, was also in Kuala Lumpur to observe the talks. ,Photo by Angela Casauay/Rappler,Once the Basic Law is passed, a transition authority \u2013 to be led by the MILF \u2013 will take over to lead the transition from the ARMM to the new Bangsamoro government until the election of officers in 2016. ,A ,Third Party Monitoring Team (TPMT), was earlier convened to monitor the implementation of the peace accord. ,Once the TPMT \u2013 as well as the government, the MILF and the Malaysian facilitator \u2013 agree that all parties have complied with the commitments outlined in the peace pact, only then will the exit agreement formally terminating the GPH-MILF negotiations be signed. ,In his ,opening statement in the 43rd round of talks,, Iqbal said he hopes the \"day of reckoning\" will come \"on or before 2016.\",The 4-decade war in Mindanao has claimed the lives of over 60,000 people, a report from the ,Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, said. ,Talks for peace between the government and the MILF gained ground under the Ramos administration but encountered a major setback when the Estrada administration declared \"all-out war\" against the troops.,The Arroyo administration managed to restart the talks and produce an initial deal known as the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domains (MOA-AD).

The burial ceremony for the late Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos is attended by close family members only. Photo from Marcos Presidential Center   ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 On a late night helicopter ride on February 25, 1986, the late dictator Ferdinand Edralin Marcos, his family, and select government officials fled Malaca\u00f1ang Palace, on the third day of the People Power Revolution. ,On Friday, November 18, thirty years after the revolution that ousted Marcos, his son, daughters, and grandchildren alighted from military helicopters, fresh from the Libingan ng mga Bayani, where Marcos had just been granted ,a hero's burial replete with a peaceful and private ceremony. ,Seated by the military chopper's open side door, former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr's white barong glistened as the dark-colored aircraft landed on Villamor Air Base past 1 pm that Friday. He alighted on one side of the chopper, while his sister Irene got off from the other side, the skirt of her white Filipiniana dress flapping against the swirl of the chopper's blades that were slowing to a halt. ,Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos, hand in hand with son Borgy Manotoc, led another group of the family that emerged from a second chopper. ,Together, the heirs to the loyalty and loathing of a divided Filipino people, walked toward the Villamor Air Base VIP Lounge as the media watched and waited for a ,statement that Imee would deliver,. ,\",Sa wakas, napatupad sa araw na ito ang huling habilin ng aking minamahal na ama, ang ating Pangulong Ferdinand Edralin Marcos:, ,na maihimlay kasama ng kanyang mga kapwa sundalo. Ang aking pamilya ay taos-pusong nagpapasalamat sa inyong lahat na nagpatotoo sa karapatan niyang mahimlay sa Libingan ng mga Bayani,\" ,she said while the rest of the family stood in the background.,(Finally, the final wish of my beloved father, our president Ferdinand Edralin Marcos, was realized on this day: that he be buried along with his fellow soldiers. My family whole-heartedly thanks all of you who stood by his right to be buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.),She thanked President Rodrigo Duterte first and foremost in the statement that took less than a minute. The family then left the venue without entertaining questions. ,The armed forces helped make that solemn day possible.,The military delivers ,The private burial is a testament to the efficiency of the armed forces when it commits itself to a goal. On Friday, they were determined to give Marcos a peaceful ceremony.,\"We always defer to the wishes of the family or the next of kin. After all, ,sila po ang ang may namatayan ,(they're the ones who are burying loved ones). We provide the services as long as it is a legal order,\" said Armed Forces spokesman Brigadier-General Restituto Padilla. ,The order came from no less than the commander-in-chief, Rodrigo Duterte, who ,pledged during his campaign, that he would allow Marcos to be buried at the Libingan. Martial law victims asked the Supreme Court to stop the burial, but the ,High Court junked their petitions,. ,COMPLIED. The Armed Forces of the Philippines succeeds in giving the Marcos family a peaceful ceremony away from protesters. Photo from Marcos Presidential Center   ,Duterte gave the orders to proceed, with the burial as soon as the Supreme Court gave the go signal. But he would be absent on the day itself.,The military claimed they were told at 5 pm the previous day only, about the Marcos family's wish to bury their patriarch at 12 noon on Friday, November 18. Military officers held a meeting that night and it took them 12 hours to prepare, according to Padilla. ,\"We were given very short notice, at exactly 5 o'clock yesterday the first word reached us and hence a flurry of activities,\" said Padilla.,It is not clear what time the military chopper left Manila for Ilocos in the early morning of Friday. But before 9 am, the chopper had picked up Marcos' remains and headed for the Libingan, where it arrived past 11 am with time to spare before the ceremony at 12 noon. ,The military honored Marcos with the usual pomp and pageantry that it gives its dead soldiers. Acting Armed Forces chief Lieutenant General Glorioso Miranda led the arrival honors and a short march to bring the small brown wooden coffin that carried Marcos' remains to the entombment area.,Generals in their elegant white duck uniforms served as ceremonial pall bearers. Marcos' children and grandchildren paraded in white barong and Filipiniana, while Imelda, who is as loved and loathed as Marcos himself, stood out in her black gown and her wheelchair. ,Soldiers then carried on their shoulders the small coffin to an entombment area exclusive to former presidents. Beside the gravesites of Elpidio Quirino, Carlos Garcia, and Diosdado Macapagal, a short program led by a military chaplain followed. Photos that were released showed a wreath from Duterte standing at the center of the burial site that the Marcos heirs themselves prepared.,\"It was very solemn,\" said Padilla.,WIDOW.

(READ: ,Top military generals absent at Marcos burial,),The final honors were rendered. The deafening 21-gun salute was heard from a distance. The usually heart-wrenching sound of the taps was played and a volley of shots was fired. \"This is a salute, a final salute to any soldier who is laid to rest,\" said Padilla.,The short notice wasn't a problem. Padilla said preparations were already made before the Supreme Court ordered a halt to activities while the justices deliberated. Besides, the military has dedicated troops who practically do nothing else but honor dead soldiers. It was only a matter of bringing them to the ceremony. ,Key to the success of the private burial was its secrecy. Indeed, news of the burial did not come out until about a few hours before noon. The night before, however, there was already word that the burial would happen over the weekend. ,The two military choppers that flew Marcos' remains from Ilocos straight to the Libingan, and the Marcos heirs from the Libingan to Villamor Air Base where their statement was delivered, also protected Marcos and his family members from protesters. ,Protests outside Libingan,Outside the Libingan were small groups of protesters, loyal supporters, and the media  who rushed to the site as soon as they heard the news. It was no longer the responsibility of the military, whose tasks were limited to inside military facilities only such as the Libingan and Villamor Air Base. ,The police, who also learned about the burial Thursday afternoon, took care of guarding the exterior, especially from protesters out to disrupt the ceremony that, to them, the dictator did not deserve. ,\"A lot of things are going to happen today,\" was all that Philippine National Police chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa said early Friday. He was en route to the ,arrival of alleged Eastern Visayas drug lord Kerwin Espinosa, from Abu Dhabi. ,Before proceeding to the Senate for budget deliberations, Dela Rosa paid a quick visit to the Heroes' Cemetery \u2013 a confirmation of suspicions that a Marcos burial was afoot that day.,Camp Crame officials said they began coordination with Police Regional Office 1 officials only on Friday morning itself.

{"author": "", "date": "2013-11-30T14:46:56+0800", "content": "\nThe law creating the NDRRMC may have its innovations, but it fails Yolanda's horrific test    ,(First of 2 parts),MANILA, Philippines - Some 48 hours before Yolanda (Haiyan) hit land on November 8, the operations center of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) was already on \"red alert status.\" Its regional and local counterparts that were on the path of the super typhoon were ordered to take preventive measures.,As in previous disaster situations, different government agencies started mobilizing resources in anticipation of a huge disaster. After all, Yolanda was expected to traverse 9 regions before leaving the Philippine Area of Responsibility.,The Department of National Defense (DND), Department of Health (DOH),  Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) prepositioned their respective resources, while other government agencies activated their own response teams.,The Office of Civil Defense (OCD), which serves as the secretariat of the NDRRMC, was disseminating weather bulletins round the clock to the local and regional disaster risk reduction and management councils. With the growing ferocity of Super Typhoon Yolanda, the entire government disaster machinery had already clearly shifted gear from preparedness to response and relief mode.,What initially appeared to be a routine drill was fast becoming an emergency situation for disaster officials as Yolanda moved closer to the country. On November 6, or two days before Yolanda was expected to strike, Malaca\u00f1ang decided to be on top of the situation.,Roles and functions,The NDRRMC\u2019s first update on Yolanda preparations showed that the NDRRMC convened an emergency meeting that was presided over by Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa Jr \u201cto discuss preparations of each member-agency.\u201d,That Ochoa, who was city administrator of Quezon City for 9 years, would preside over the meeting could be interpreted as Malaca\u00f1ang taking Yolanda\u2019s threat seriously but this was out of the norm. In the past, it was either the Defense Secretary or the President himself who would preside over the NDRRMC meetings. It was Ochoa\u2019s first time to preside over such a meeting since Typhoon Butchoy struck in 2012.,EXECUTIVE SECRETARY. In the early days after Typhoon Yolanda hit land, Paquito Ochoa takes charge. Malaca\u00f1ang file photo,Under what was then called the National Disaster Coordinating Council, it was either the President or the defense chief who was at the forefront of disaster preparation and response. But the 3-year old RA 10121, or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act has delineated functions and responsibilities based on clusters. (READ: ,Fast Facts: The NDRRMC,),As such, for disaster prevention and mitigation, the law mandates the Department of Science and Technology to be in charge, while for disaster preparedness, it is the Department of the Interior and Local Government. For disaster response, the overall responsibility rests with the DSWD, while disaster rehabilitation and recovery lies with the National Economic and Development Authority. The different heads of these government offices are named vice-chairpersons of the NDRRMC.,Under the hierarchical structure of the NDRRMC, the Executive Secretary, in fact, is just a member of the council. It is the DND chief who\u2019s supposed to be on top, retaining the position as chairman.,It is the OCD, which is under the DND, that oversees and sees to it that the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (NDRRMP) is implemented from the national to the ,regional and local DRRM units,. Such task is overseen by the NDRRMC secretariat, headed by executive director Eduardo del Rosario.,TOWARDS REHABILITATION. The NDRRMC's Eduardo del Rosario says that the government will focus on shelter, livelihood, agriculture and fisheries in rehabilitation efforts. Screenshot of ANC coverage,The different assignments were in place in past natural calamities and catastrophes like Typhoon Pablo and (Tropical Storm) Sendong, and the recent earthquake that hit Bohol in October. But Yolanda was a different matter. \u201cThere were too many actors at play. You do not know who is really in charge at one point,\u201d observed a member of a civil society organization (CSO) that helped craft and fine-tune RA 10121.,Such observation was evident when Cabinet Secretary Jose Almendras was asked by reporters in Malaca\u00f1ang 5 days after Yolanda pounded Eastern Visayas who was in charge. \u201cThe one\u2019s calling the shots are actually the President and the Cabinet secretaries,\u201d he said.,Del Rosario for his part, said, \u201cIt\u2019s the Executive Secretary ably assisted by Secretary Almendras.\u201d,On the ground, particularly in Tacloban City, aid workers interviewed by Rappler expressed frustration that they \u201chave so many bosses but nobody makes decisions.\u201d Amid this confusion, DILG Secretary Mar Roxas had to fend off reports that he tried to emasculate Tacloban City Mayor Alfred Romualdez.,Asked who was the ground commander there, Roxas said no one, adding that decisions were arrived at, following a \u201dconsultative process.\u201d (READ: ,Who calls the shots after Haiyan?,),CHIEF. Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas takes over the front seat during the disaster response phase after Yolanda (Haiyan) hits land. File photo by Ayee Macaraig/Rappler,Defense chief sidelined?,As chairman of the NDRRMC, Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin was supposed to be running the show. If RA 10121 was strictly followed, his vice-chair would have been DWSD Secretary Dinky Soliman.,But for some reason, neither Gazmin nor Soliman was running the entire show. In Manila, it was Ochoa and Almendras and in the disaster-stricken areas, it was Roxas who was holding the baton for disaster response. \u201cDinky was reporting to Roxas. All the military officials in Tacloban were reporting to him,\u201d a local reporter who works for a Japanese wire agency observed.,In one command conference presided over by Roxas that was off-limits to reporters, the reporter saw the DILG chief berating a military official over some report. \u201cYou are wasting our time. Sit down and talk to me when you have something good to say,\u201d Roxas scolded the military official. The journalist was able to sneak into the meeting unnoticed.,In one separate interview, one reporter relayed to Gazmin the observation that he was not so visible in the response and recovery efforts \u2013 an observation Gazmin did not seem to be too pleased about. ,WHERE WAS HE? Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin is supposed to play a key role in disaster situations. Photo by Carmela Fonbuena/Rappler,Civil society organizations involved in disaster preparedness projects also observed that Gazmin was relegated to a supporting role in the Yolanda crisis. \u201cHe was not prominent in the relief and response operations, at least from the reports I saw. When Typhoon Sendong and Pablo struck, he was very visible,\u201d Lorna Victoria, a director at the Center for Disaster Preparedness, said. Typhoons Sendong and Pablo occurred in 2011 and 2012.,The journalist, who had covered the defense beat for years, said the military has a different culture and taking orders from a non-military official, or an indirect superior, has its drawbacks. \u201cI got feedback from the military officials stationed in Eastern Visayas that had they just been allowed to do their job, the relief operations would not have been delayed.\u201d,That Gazmin took the backseat on the Yolanda response operations was not lost on Sen Juan Ponce Enrile, a former defense chief himself. During a budget hearing, he castigated Gazmin for failing to take command over the disaster situation.,\u201cWhy was the Defense chief relegated to a support position when he was supposed to be in command?\u201d Enrile asked, recalling that during his time, it was always the military that was first to respond. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have the military manpower. The military is always the one in command.\u201d,Reluctant president,Amid all these, the President hedged in declaring a state of national calamity or even ,national emergency,, even if reports of a breakdown in law and order had erupted \u2013 particularly in Tacloban City where survivors had resorted to looting.,Three days after Yolanda slammed Eastern Samar, Presidential  Communications Office head Herminio Coloma Jr sent a text message to Palace reporters that Malaca\u00f1ang was still studying whether to declare a state of calamity.,Aquino was also reported to have ,walked out, after being pressed by affected businessmen to declare a state of emergency in Tacloban to contain chaos and lawlessness. (The Palace later said he just took a bathroom break.) A state of emergency would have allowed the national government to assume key functions from the LGU, particularly the crippled Tacloban city government.,But Aquino said the initiative to declare a state emergency should come from the LGU.,HESITATION. President Benigno Aquino III treads carefully in declaring a state of emergency after Yolanda leaves behind a trail of destruction in Eastern Visayas. Rappler file photo,Constitutionalist and former Supreme Court justice Vicente Mendoza, in a phone interview, said the President could, on his own, declare a state of emergency as part of his broad powers. \u201cHe is the one in command. He can decide whether to declare a state of emergency based on the report of his subordinates, in this case, the military officials.\u201d,Given the magnitude of the disaster situation, Mendoza said a declaration of a state of emergency would have given the President extra powers to normalize the situation. \u201cHe can order the Armed Forces to restore peace and order. Let the critics question the declaration in the courts. Why,  would you have questioned such act, given the gravity and the necessity of the situation?\u201d,It was only on the 3rd day that ,Aquino finally declared a state of national calamity, after returning from devastated Tacloban.,DRRM fund,Based on its name alone, the NDCC\u2019s function was primarily for disaster response and proponents had wanted a more pro-active approach against disasters, given that the Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries. A creation of PD 1566 which was enacted in 1978, the NDCC was deemed to be no longer responsive to the increasing challenges on disaster management.,In 2009, the Philippines ratified the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response, which is the ASEAN\u2019s commitment to the Hyogo Framework of Action. The latter was developed following the 2004 tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people. The Philippine ratification of the ASEAN agreement paved the way for the revamp of the NDCC.,Aiming for a holistic approach to disaster management, proponents of RA 10121 sought to refocus the approach, giving more emphasis on disaster risk reduction and identifying vulnerability rather than concentrating on just disaster response. It expanded membership to include other government agencies and tasked the local government units (LGUs) to be frontliners and first responders in disaster management.,Apart from creating 4 clusters on disaster management with Cabinet secretaries as vice-chairmen, RA 10121 broadened the powers and responsibilities of LGUs by mandating them to allocate \"at least\" 5% of their Internal Revenue Allotment to support DRRM activities \u2013 from training to funding preparedness programs to procurement of disaster response and rescue equipment, said Maria Cagay, deputy executive director of Center for Disaster Preparedness and National Anti-Poverty Commission representative (victims of disaster and calamities).,Cagay explained that this provision under the law allows LGUs to tap DRRM funds without the need to declare a state of calamity in an area, which was a requirement in the past. It also allows the LGUs to use any unused DRRM funds as a revolving fund to finance DRRM activities in the future. Likewise, it grants LGUs some flexibility in using funds to help other distressed LGUs affected by calamities.,Cagay said the only caveat is that LGUs cannot tap the funds if they have not submitted any local DRRM plan. \u201cThis is to ensure that the DRRM fund is properly utilized,\u201d she said.,The new law also allows the LGUs, through the local Sanggunian or council, to declare and lift a state of calamity within their locality. In a state of calamity, price control is imposed to prevent profiteering and hoarding. It also allows the LGUs to reprogram their funds for repair and reconstruction., While RA 10121 may contain innovations for frontliner LGUs, it failed Yolanda's horrific test. ,(,To be concluded,), - ,Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/44956-ndrrmc-assessment-disaster-management", "title": "NDRRMC: Too many cooks spoil the broth"},

Yolanda damage to Tacloban's one and only airport was a big blow to the city's economy. Photo by EPA/Francis Malasig,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 No wonder it was the worst hit by Super Typhoon Yolanda (international name: Haiyan). Tacloban City was deemed the most vulnerable to climate change among 4 Philippine cities assessed by a ,new study,. ,From a range of 1 to 10 \u2013 with 10 being most vulnerable \u2013 Tacloban was rated 6.74 in terms of how exposed it is to climate change impacts, like stronger storms, extreme droughts, sea level rise, and aggravated flooding and landslides.,The study, conducted by Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Philippines and BPI Foundation, gave this score based on 3 factors: climate or environmental exposure, socio-economic sensitivity, and capacity to adapt. ,Climate or environmental exposure ,Tacloban's location on the country's eastern seaboard exposes it to many climate risks, like tropical cyclones during the southwest monsoon.,Even before Typhoon Yolanda hit the city on Nov 8, 2013, Tacloban was already feeling the effects of a shifting climate.,Records show that from 1998 to 2011, there was a 257% increase in rainfall, from 1,853 mm to 4,768 mm. Over a 50-year period, the city has been hit by an average of 2.3 typhoons a year. No wonder more flooding has been reported by residents. ,Geohazard maps of the city also show high susceptibility to landslides, particularly for its upland villages. Being only 3 meters above sea level, Tacloban is also threatened by sea level rise. Studies show that seas can rise by 4 to 6 meters due to climate change.,For these reasons, Tacloban is said to be within the jaws of a \"climate sandwich.\",Socio-economic sensitivity,Tacloban is a growing city.,Over 20 years, its population has risen by 62% from around 136,000 in 1990 to around 221,000 in 2010. More houses have been built (74% more in less than two decades), more cars are on the road (312% increase in 20 years). ,The more people in a city, the more vulnerable to climate change the city is.,Tacloban's economy is tied to its port. Domestic cargo is a growing business, with volumes increasing by 63% from 2008 to 2012.,Its airport is also a major source of economic growth. ,Spurred by airline promos, ,air passengers to and from Tacloban almost doubled from 2000 to 2011. ,Its fishing industry is an important economic contributor. Municipal fisheries reported a 63% increase in catch while aquaculture production has tripled. Ocean acidification, or the change in Ph levels of sea waters, can threaten fish supply. The climate change-related phenomenon can kill coral reefs and impair the development of some marine species.,Adaptive capacity,How capable is Tacloban of getting back on its feet after a severe storm or another climate-related event?,Citizens appear to have enough resources to recover, at least partially, whatever losses they incur. Average annual savings rose from just P4,000 in 1991 to P32,000 in 2009. The number of bank accounts also increased by 30%.,But the city government is not so lucky. City savings dropped from around P120,000 in 2002 to P83,000 in 2011. ,Recommendations ,Given its susceptibility to flooding and sea level rise, Tacloban should upgrade its drainage system. It should also manage its upland communities, which are threatened by landslides. ,But Tacloban can turn increasing rainfall into an opportunity instead of a problem. The study recommends that the city impound rainwater for urban and agricultural use. This would solve its current water supply and water quality problem.,Being dependent on air passengers for its growing economy, Tacloban should rethink the location of its single airport. Putting seawalls may not be enough.  ,***,Tacloban is one of 4 cities assessed by the study.

Storm surges that reached 100 m inland proved that living right by the sea is not safe. Many of the casualties in Leyte were due to storm surges devastating coastal communities.,But the no-build-zone rule does not sit well with fishermen who need to be close to the sea in order to pursue their livelihood. (,IN PHOTOS: Rebuilding lives inside the 'no-build' zone,),Fishermen need their boats near the sea. In fishing communities, most fishermen have their boats by the doorways of their homes. They need only push them across the sand to get to the shore a few meters away.,For fishermen whose fathers were also fishermen before them, it has been this way for generations, even through storms and rough waves.,Following the no-build zone rule, the barangay captain wants to move the fishermen nearer the barangay center \u2013 far away from their boats and the sea.,\u201c,Napakalayo.

Upon seeing her, a handful of people would start talking in hushed tones, wondering who the vaguely familiar woman was.

Parang ako, lumundag muna bago mag-plano, (They already have organizations in place, they already thought about how they\u2019d run their campaigns. I took a leap even before I made plans),\u201d she said on the sidelines of their last provincial rally in her hometown of Naga City. ,Beyond Jesse,When Leni Robredo takes the stage during campaign rallies, it\u2019s not unusual for the audience to fall silent, stay quiet, and at times shed a tear or two. ,Unlike the candidates who speak before and will speak after her, hers is a speech that\u2019s almost always devoid of jokes, barely contains promises, and makes no mention of the gains of the administration, of which she is a part.,Instead, she tells a story. ,It is part coming-of-age and part love story, as she tells the audience why she joined public service, how she met her late husband Jesse Robredo, about her struggles as a young-mother-slash-lawyer, why she chose to lawyer for the poor, about the pain of losing the love of her life, and eventually, how and why she found herself gunning for an elective post in 2013. ,Jesse, former interior secretary and long-time Naga mayor, is a prominent character in her narrative. After all, Jesse had always been \u2013 and was always supposed to be \u2013 the lone Robredo in government.,But those plans changed on August 18, 2012, when the plane he was riding crashed off the coast of Masbate.,GRIEF.

Before, I\u2019d always say \u2018never.\u2019 With my husband\u2019s death came the acceptance that anything is possible.) ,But being Jesse\u2019s widow was both a boon and bane for Robredo during the campaign. ,While the \u201cRobredo brand\u201d offered familiarity, many criticized her for \u201cnecro-politics\u201d \u2013 or using the death of a loved one for political gain. There were also those who hit her for being \u201conly\u201d Jesse\u2019s widow and for supposedly having nothing else to show.,Yet, she converted non-believers every step of the way. And there's no better proof of this than the upward trajectory of her survey numbers leading to election day on May 9, 2016.,Crafting her own narrative,The challenge, Robredo told Rappler in an interview, was to introduce herself while letting people know she was more than just her captivating story. ,The reluctant politician spent the past decades working behind the scenes, helping her husband lead and manage Naga as a mayor. ,WITH THE PEOPLE. Meeting with constituents in a remote barangay in Camarines Sur. Photo from Leni Robredo Facebook ,Yet it was also Jesse who always imagined his wife as an ideal fit in politics and governance. Whenever he\u2019d hit the term limit as Naga City mayor (in the Philippines, you are only allowed a maximum of 3 consecutive mayoralty terms), allies would clamor for Leni Robredo to take over. ,\u201cAll those times, ,parati kong sinasabi sa kanya: hindi ko 'yan kaya. Parati niyang sinasabi sa akin na kulang ang paniniwala mo sa sarili mo na siguro hindi ko naman nagawa itong lahat kung wala ka.

Maybe I was really the wind beneath his wings.),The year 2013 proved Jesse Robredo right.,Slaying a dynasty,Barely a year had passed since her husband died when their political allies in Camarines Sur started fighting months before the 2013 senatorial and local elections. Supporters told her only she could end the wrangling \u2013 by running.,At the last minute, Leni Robredo was persuaded to run for Congress against Nelly Villafuerte of the politically entrenched Camarines Sur clan. ,Unlike Villafuerte, Robredo had little campaign funds to speak of. Instead of big rallies, she\u2019d campaign before small groups, bringing with her a ragtag army of campaign volunteers and a portable sound system. Villafuerte would counter by hosting huge gatherings with generous raffle prizes. ,Robredo won that race \u2013 and by a landslide.,NEOPHYTE WINS.

Ito po ang lagi kong pinag yayabang, kahit saan ako mapunta, doon po sa amin sa Naga, doon sa aming distrito kahit wala kang pera, pwede kang manalo. Sa tingin ko po napakalaking leksyon po ito para palitan na natin ang mukha ng eleksyon, para palitan na natin ang mukha ng pulitika,,\u201d she told fellow Nagaue\u00f1os during the party\u2019s last provincial rally on May 5. ,(Money isn\u2019t the most important thing in elections because even if people accept these favors, they\u2019ll vote according to conscience. Everywhere I go, I boast of this: back home in Naga, in my district, even if you don\u2019t have money, you can win. I think this is a valuable lesson for us to change the way elections work, the way politics works.) ,The comfort of Naga,It\u2019s in Naga and her Camarines Sur district where Robredo feels the most at ease. It\u2019s in Naga where she can arrange quick meets with her high school batchmates in between sorties, it\u2019s in Naga where she can walk into a local salon without fanfare or the slightest bit of attention.,She was born in the city. It's where she grew up, fell in love, raised a family.,One of Robredo\u2019s favorite stories told and retold in the campaign involves her first and last pregnancies. ,She was due in a few weeks\u2019 time just as Jesse was campaigning for his first term as Naga City mayor. There was a rally in a far-flung barangay and Robredo herself had to haul the sound system. She even did the heavy lifting by herself. ,\u201cIt\u2019s because then, only Jesse and I believed in each other,\u201d she said, laughing. ,Just as soon as she was done driving from the rally venue, Robredo\u2019s water broke. She went to the hospital and gave birth to their eldest daughter, Aika. \u201cWhen Jesse came, his child was already there,\u201d mused Robredo. ,Years later, Robredo had taken on a job with Saligan, an alternative law group that catered mostly to the poor. During one trip to a far-flung island barangay, a pregnant Robredo had to ride a ,habal-habal, (motorcycle) and a ,bangka, (boat) to reach a community of fisherfolk.,They were going to hold a seminar to teach locals their rights under the law. They slept inside the fishermen\u2019s boats and moved to nap under coconut trees when the men had to fish early in the morning. ,'From 1 percent to vice president',The national stage offered a different terrain, which explains her initial reluctance to conquer it. But when she decided to go for it, Robredo ,embraced all its demands and complexities.,\u201cI may be new in politics,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not new to public service.\u201d,\u201cMany say to be an empowered woman of our society, we always have to stand up and be heard, that all have to listen to our voice at every opportunity. Many say gender equality is all about being as strong as a man [but] in my life at least, it meant knowing when to let go of the limelight and knowing when to step up.\",ONSTAGE.

Hindi malulutas ng krimen ang mga kriminalidad.\", (If you think that what you're doing is public service, you are wrong.

Before this, he served as auxiliary bishop of San Fernando, Pampanga, for nearly a decade.,'Termites' in society,In his homily on Sunday, David compared vigilantes to white termites who silently gnaw on wood from the inside, until all that remains is wooden skin.,He explained that termites would make it seem like the foundations of a house remain sturdy. ,\"Iyon pala parang sitsaron; wala nang laman sa loob, kinain na ng anay, at minsan bigla na lang mawawasak, guguho ang bahay.\", (Then it turns out to be like pork cracklings; it is empty inside, eaten by termites, and sometimes will just collapse.),\"Ito ang mas nakakatakot at tunay na salot,\", the bishop said. ,\"Hindi lang mga bahay ang inaanay. Ang lipunan din.\", (This is the real and more terrifying plague... Termites attack not only homes, but also society.),David then cited vigilantes in the cities of Navotas, Caloocan, and Malabon, who kill people every day, \"like white termites who remain unseen.\",David questioned why police and village officials fail to catch these vigilantes, even if closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras can be found on every street., ,David said: ,\"'Yung mga simpleng pagnanakaw katulad nu'ng mga humahablot ng bag sa kalsada, madalas nakikita natin 'yan sa TV. Pero 'yung dumudukot ng tao sa harapan ng sariling mga anak at kapamilya, at pumapaslang sa kanila na walang kalaban-laban, sa ating mga purok, sa ating mga kalye, sa ating mga barangay, hindi sila nakikita.

But those who abduct people in front of their children and relatives, and kill them who are helpless, in our communities, our streets, our villages, cannot be seen. Why? Are they invisible?),8 people killed in 5 minutes,On DUIs, David said, ,\"Gusto ko sanang malaman kung meron na bang nareresolba, kahit isa, sa mga death under investigation? Kahit isa lang.\", (I just want to know if they have resolved even just one of these cases of deaths under investigation? Even just one.),He pointed out that in cases of EJKs, police reports usually state that the victim is a \"drug suspect killed by unidentified hitmen.\",\"Kapag tinatanong ko ang kapulisan tungkol sa mga pinapaslang ng mga bonnet gang, kadalasan sinasabi nila, 'Drug suspect talaga 'yon.' Matagal nang nasa drug watch list nila. Na parang ibig sabihin, case closed. Na para bang ibig sabihin, okay lang na pinatay sila dahil adik naman talaga o pusher talaga,\", he said.,(Whenever I ask policemen about those being killed by bonnet gangs, they often say, \"That's really a drug suspect.\" They say he's really on their drug watch list. As if to say, case closed. As if to mean, it was okay to kill them because they're really addicts or pushers.),TEACHING HIS FLOCK.

All 4 of them ended up killed in front of Santor's house \u2013 Jonel Segovia, 15; Sonny Espinosa, 16; Angelito Soriano, 16; and Kenneth Lim, 20.,Inside Santor's house, he said vigilantes also massacred Santor's mother, Cristina; his brother, Ednel; and his pregnant sister, Analyn.,\"Sa loob ng 5 minuto, 8 ang napatay nila, kasama na ang sanggol sa tiyan ni Analyn. Pero ang talagang hinahanap nila ay hindi nila natagpuan doon,\", David said. (In 5 minutes, they killed 8 people, including the baby in the womb of Analyn. But they failed to find the one they were really looking for.),\"Pagkatapos ng 3 araw, lumabas sa balita, Jay-R Santor, napaslang. Nahanap na rin nila. Pero ubos ang buong pamilya ni Jay-R Santor,\", he added. (After 3 days, the news said Jay-R Santor was killed. They were able to find him. But Jay-R Santor's family was also wiped out.),'New Judases',David closed his homily with a prayer, asking God's forgiveness for all these sins.,\"Salamat sa biyaya ng Eukaristiya, sa biyaya ng patawad at kaligtasan, pati na sa mga traydor at mga bagong Hudas sa aming bayan,\", he said. (Thank you for the gift of the Eucharist, for the gifts of forgiveness and salvation, even for the traitors and new Judases in our country.),For many Catholics who joined the mass for EJK victims, however, the \"termites\" appeared to have made their presence felt during Sunday's Mass.,At around 4:30 am on Sunday ,\u2013 or 30 minutes before the Walk for Life began \u2013, members of the San Jose de Navotas Parish learned that there was no electricity in their church.,Aurora Santiago, president of the Council of the Laity of the Diocese of Kalookan, said there was electricity in the priest's residence and the nearby school, and the outage curiously affected only the church building itself.,David said Mass using only a generator connected to either the priest's residence or the nearby school.,\"Hindi ho namin maintindihan kung bakit walang kuryente dito lang sa simbahan. May kuryente ho sa buong Navotas, pero dito lang sa simbahan, biglang nawala,\", David said at the start of his homily.,(We can't understand why there's no power only here in church. There's power in the whole of Navotas, but it is gone only here.),\"Ewan ko lang kung bakit nangyayari ang mga bagay-bagay na ito. Parang may ibig pumigil sa ating dapat gawin ngayong umaga, (I don't know why things like this are happening.

Photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler  ,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 Associate Justice Mariano del Castillo during his interpellation of anti-martial law petitioners on Tuesday, June 13, indicated that the siege in Marawi can be considered an act of rebellion, and therefore sufficient basis to declare martial law in Mindanao.,For Del Castillo, the presence of foreign terrorists in Marawi City \u2013 especially the raising of an ISIS flag there \u2013 is sufficient basis to say that it is a case of rebellion. (READ: ,Military knew as early as April the Marawi attack plan \u2013 Calida,),\"They're precisely putting up their flag there to supplant the authority of the local government of their own, in effect they're trying to remove the allegiance of Marawi City from the government,\" Del Castillo told Albay First District Representative Edcel Lagman, who argued for the ,minority lawmakers group of petitioners,.,But Lagman stuck to his old argument and said the raising of an ISIS flag is the terror groups' longtime resort to \"cheap propaganda.\",Del Castillo was the first justice to interpellate petitioners before the break shortly before noon.  ,(READ: ,Nullify martial law?

Albay First District Representative Edcel Lagman is the lead oralist for his group consisting of minority lawmakers in the oral arguments at the Supreme Court (SC).

Being a working mom can be challenging but this should not keep you from achieving your financial goals.,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Despite co-hosting two regular shows (the daily morning show Unang Hirit and the weeknights lifestyle show Mars on GMA), plus events hosting, Suzi Entrata-Abrera is still a hands-on mother to three daughters, and wife of 12 years to morning TV show host and environmentalist Paolo Abrera.,Here, Suzi tells how she and her husband are achieving their financial goals for their family\u2019s future, as she shared with the audience of Sun Life Philippines\u2019 Brighter Life Financial Planning Series held in September.,1. Delegate,Suzi is thankful, and jokingly shares, pressured with the trust that Paolo gave her to manage the household finances. They have a fund where they put in all their income, and 50% of it is spent on investing; repairing parts of the house or car or acquiring a property; and dating and traveling as a couple. ,\u201cWomen are detailed. It is really the women who are entrusted with the finances because of our ability to note down everything down to the last detail \u2026 but if the man feels he is more detailed than the wife, then he should be the one to be in-charge of the finances,\u201d Suzi says.,2. Teach them while they are young,Suzi shares that weekly, Paolo gives their daughters P50 each to buy whatever they like (since they already have their ,baon,). Then they\u2019d ask them what they bought with it. One time, one of their daughters incurred a debt from their school\u2019s store because she was buying goodies for her friends. When Suzi found out, she went to the school and told the storekeeper to not give their daughter any ,pautang, as it defeats the purpose of teaching them the value of money.,Teaching your kids about credit cards is a tougher act, Suzi adds. Sometimes, her daughters would ask them to buy them something, and they would have to \u201clie\u201d and tell them they have no money. \u201cBut you have your credit card,\u201d Suzi quotes her kids.,\u201cThat\u2019s why I show them my billing statement. Every time I swipe the card, I show them the billing statement listing everything I have to pay. Of course, they still find it difficult to understand especially I only pay my bill online or through phone banking. They do not see the \u2018money\u2019 in there,\u201d Suzi says.,3. Learn when to say \u201cno\u201d,Suzi is making sure that her weekends are free for her family. If they ever come second, she make up for it big time. \u201cThere are times the project is so big that you could not just decline it, ,babawi ako ng malaki sa mga anak ko, (I\u2019ll make it up to them big time). They like toys, so we give them those as ,pambawi,,\u201d she shares.,Learning when to say \u201cno\u201d is also important. Suzi says that when she was younger, she would just grab whatever project that would come her way, but all that changed because of her family. \u201cMy family is on top of my list. ,Minsan manghihinayang ka sa kikitain mo, pero pamilya pa rin ang dapat una sa lahat ,(Sometimes, you\u2019ll regret not earning that money, but family should come first,\u201d Suzi stresses.,4. Set clear goals and fund your dreams.,Have a practical timetable. That\u2019s why it is important to stick to your timeline and plow the needed resources into it. \u201cHave a vision down to the last detail to make goals more exciting,\u201d she says.,She shares that they are now saving for a house, to be ready in four years\u2019 time. Suzi and Paolo want to have a sturdy home for their daughters where they can still live for years to come. They also want it to be a \u201cgreen\u201d home considering the natural calamities we are experiencing.  It should also have a bigger \u201chandyman\u201d room for Paolo who dabbles into blacksmith, carpentry, and ornamental iron works as Suzi proudly shares that her accessories are made only for her by Paolo.,5. Begin a savings habit,\u201cMy savings habit has changed over the years,\u201d Suzi shares. She cites that she learned the value of hard-earned money from her mother, who as a working mom was doing her best to keep their business afloat. \u201c,Maipon na ako kahit noon pa, (I was a saver even before),\u201d she says, adding she adheres to income less savings is equal to expenses. ,Decluttering is also a must for Suzi. She says she and her friends from Ateneo hold a garage sale twice or thrice a year. \u201cWhen we declutter, sometimes we find out we have an extra dress or a pair of shoes of the same style but different color, and we actually do not need those extras. For a time I was also collecting designer bags. ,Aminin ninyo, ang iba sa inyo, bumili rin ng mga, bag (Admit it, some of you also buy bags), installment basis,\u201d earning laughter from the audience.,\u201cMy \u2018excuse\u2019 now for having those bags is that my daughters will have them when they grow up. Also, if we were able to buy the \u2018basic\u2019 pieces of jewelry, like a pair of pearl or diamond stud earrings, we should be okay. We really do not need too many of such things,\u201d Suzi shares.,6. Prepare for emergencies,The prescribed emergency fund should be equivalent to three to six times of your monthly expenses. The fund can be used to tide you over financially in case of sudden illness, unemployment or if you need to relocate due to a natural calamity.,Preparing for an illness in the family or a natural calamity still needs to be fully ingrained among majority of the Filipinos. \u201cTayong mga Filipino, ubusan ng yaman talaga. Kahit walang-wala na, gagawa tayo ng paraan maligtas lang natin ang mahal natin sa buhay (Down to the last centavo. Even if we have nothing, we will make a way to save the lives of our loved once). But you don\u2019t want all of your hard-earned money to dwindle because of an illness in the family,\u201d Suzi emphasizes.,7. Get insured,\u201cMy mother taught me the importance of insurance,\u201d Suzi shares. Thus, she and Paolo are insured and their daughters\u2019 tertiary education is funded as well. Their house and their cars are fully covered as well. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to be financially prepared and insured from life\u2019s unforeseen events,\u201d she says and adds that she has a life insurance policy that gives her insurance protection and cash benefits.,While still active in both their careers, Suzi and Paolo are already preparing for their retirement as well. \u201c,Ngayon pa lang, pinag-iipunan na namin \u2018yong retirement namin through a certain investment product or insurance product. So, \u2018pag tumanda kami, ma-enjoy naman namin \u2018yung time namin to travel together. It is the same way that my mom taught us. Kapag nagkasakit ako, ayaw kong maging pabigat ako sa aming mga anak,,\u201d Suzi details. (As early as now, we\u2019re saving for our retirement so when we grow old, we can enjoy our time and travel together. When I get sick, I don\u2019t want to be a burden to my children.),8. Make money, earn more,\u201cThere are several ways to make the money you earn, earn more,\u201d Suzi says. She shares that she has several investments and other financial products to keep her financial portfolio diversified. Apart from bank accounts, she also has mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and UITFs (unit investment trust funds). \u201cThere is more to savings than just savings account. Those other financial products ensure that my money earns more,\u201d Suzi says.,9. Seek professional advice,You can benefit from the expertise of financial planners who can assist you in prioritizing your life goals, crunching the numbers, and recommending solutions to your financial planning concerns. \u201cYou would be surprised at how much you can learn,\u201d she cites.,Suzi also suggests talking to your bank\u2019s investment professionals as most banks have tie-ins with insurance companies, while mutual funds are both offered by banks and insurance companies. \u201cIt might be confusing at the beginning, and we're always in a rush that it is hard to absorb everything in one sitting. But when you do, it is so eye-opening, like 'you mean I can earn this much?' Of course not without a bit of a risk. Thus, I invest only in what I am comfortable with. Talk to a professional for a whole slew of financial products you can choose from,\u201d she says.,10. Stay the course,Keep track of your progress regularly when implementing a plan. She shares that sometimes her triathlete husband would tell her that his friends have already upgraded their bicycles. But their goal to have a house in four years prevail, thus Paolo remains content tuning up his bicycle from time to time. \u201cSince you have thought about it good and hard, try to stick your guns,\u201d Suzi advises.,\u2013 Rappler.com, ,Working mother and child image via Shutterstock", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/business/personal-finance/41796-10-money-savvy-tips-for-working-moms", "title": "10 money-savvy tips for working moms"},

The plan should also enable communities to respond and recover easily when disaster strikes.,What does it take to be a climate-resilient and disaster-ready community?,1. Know about climate change and its impact,Climate change is more than just jargon. It's a real phenomena endangering the human race, ecosystems and the entire planet.,Climate change is the result of global warming or the increase in the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. This warming happens when the warmth of the sun cannot escape the atmosphere because of gases filling the air and blocking their path. Called greenhouse gases because of their \"greenhouse\" effect, they include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.,Carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas, comes mainly from the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil to generate electricity or provide fuel for vehicles.,Global warming creates a domino effect that ultimately affects natural phenomena like climate, seasons and sea level. It leads to the extreme weather events now becoming more and more common: super typhoons, heatwaves, droughts and storm surge (flooding caused by abnormal sea level rise).,Knowing about these impacts can better prepare communities for them. ,2. Assess vulnerabilities to reduce risks,All communities must know their weakest points. Tools like geohazard mapping and ,climate change scenario mapping, can allow community leaders to see which areas are vulnerable to landslides, flooding and storm surge.,For example, people living close to the shore can be moved to higher ground. Urban planners and architects will know where to build evacuation centers, hospitals, schools and government buildings so they can withstand disasters.,Such assessments can tell environmentalists to concentrate reforestation programs in landslide prone areas or tell city planners to put high-capacity drainage systems where it is likely to flood the most. (READ: ,DENR to restore mangrove forests in Yolanda-hit areas,),They can also help officials decide if some settlements, especially those near the shore, should permanently relocate because of the huge risks posed by their location. In the case of Yolanda for example, coastal and island communities were the worst-hit by tsunami-like storm surges, some higher than 15 feet. (READ: ,Storm surges flood Tacloban,),3. Integrated approach to adaptation,From knowing the community's weak points, the community can adapt to become stronger and more resilient even before disaster strikes. Some of the most vulnerable areas are ecosystems, agriculture, ,water management, ,energy, infrastructure and food security.,The more intact and balanced an ,ecosystem, is, the more likely it can survive disasters. Ecosystems, whether aquatic or forest, are often the lifelines of communities which depend on them for food and livelihood. To make these communities less vulnerable to climate change and disasters, ecosystems should be protected from deforestation, illegal poaching and destruction of coral reefs or mangrove forests. (READ: ,Mangroves are PH's best shield vs climate change,),Agriculture, must be made climate-responsive. LGUs should help farmers make use of new technology that can protect their crops from climate change. This can include new harvesting and planting techniques, climate-resilient crop varieties.,Water management, entails being able to control the amount of water in a community. LGUs located near water basins or water sheds must be able to lessen or stop the overflow of water into the community to prevent flooding. Efficient and well-thought-of drainage systems must also be in place.,The community's, energy, should not be completely reliant on fossil fuel and the national power grid. The LGU should invest in renewable energy like solar, wind and geothermal power which can provide electricity even when main power lines are cut off by storms. Eventually, the community should be able to make a complete shift to renewable energy because this so-called \"clean\" energy emits less carbon thus helping curb global warming. (READ: ,Green groups to DOE: What happened to renewable energy?,),Infrastructure, of houses, public buildings, government offices, bridges and roads should be built to outlast storms and storm surges. While the specific type of architecture depends on the location and situation of the community, in general, this means using robust building materials, allowing structures to be sealed from wind and elevating them. (READ: ,Time to make the Ph stadium typhoon-proof,),Food security, can be achieved by stocking up on essential food like rice to be stored in time for a disaster. But this also means strengthening agricultural systems against climate change and ensuring food from the farms and fields also reach more urbanized areas in the community.,These adaptive measures are best achieved not just by each LGU looking out only for themselves, but by adjacent LGUs helping one another. This is especially true for LGUs which share jurisdiction over mountains, forests, marine sanctuaries, water sheds and the like. LGUs can form alliances so they work together in making these areas more climate-resilient.,4. Provide funding and equipment,The national and local government must find ways to finance climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction programs. This can come in the form of disaster preparedness management grants or technical assistance for the project.,Climate justice advocates all over the world also say the funding can come from the ,Green Climate Fund,, a fund established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change specifically to help developing countries create climate change adaptation and disaster-preparedness programs.,5. Train the people,Human resources are one of the most valuable assets to have when dealing with disaster and climate change. Locals must be trained to face extreme weather events through workshops, seminars and the popularization of good practices (like evacuating to higher ground when a storm approaches). LGU leaders must guided on how to develop policies for disaster-preparedness and climate change adapation.,Best practices and good ideas should be documented and shared among the community and to other communities who can benefit from the knowledge. (READ: ,Are we ready for another Ondoy?,),All Filipinos have the right to know if their local government is pursuing programs for disaster-preparedness and resiliency to climate change. After seeing the effects of Yolanda, never has it been more necessary to make sure such programs are in place. Communities should not wait for the next deadly typhoon before being adequately prepared., \u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/44135-disaster-ready-climate-change-adaptation", "title": "5 steps to disaster-ready, climate-resilient communities"},

Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II is under fire from media for claiming he was misquoted on reports that he linked opposition lawmakers to the Marawi siege. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) called out Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II for blaming media for his false claim linking opposition lawmakers to the ,Marawi siege,.,\"No, Mr Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, we, the media, will not be the scapegoats as you try to weasel your way out of your latest bout of foot-in-mouth disease,\" the NUJP said in a ,statement, on Thursday, June 8.,Aguirre came under fire after he alleged in a news briefing that several opposition lawmakers went to Marawi City prior to the siege, and even met with prominent families there. This, he claimed, might have had something to do with the clashes and a destabilization plot against President Rodrigo Duterte.,The lawmakers \u2013 Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV, Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, and Magdalo Representative Gary Alejano \u2013 denied the allegation and provided documentary evidence to prove where they were on May 2, the date they supposedly had a meeting at the Lake View Resort Hotel with the prominent clans in Marawi.,The justice chief later withdrew his claim, saying he was just \"misquoted\" by the media. He had personally apologized to Aquino, who ,demanded a public apology, from the Cabinet official.,In response, the NUJP said: \"There was no misquotation. Your words were recorded on video and audio. So, no, you are not passing the buck on to reporters who did what they are supposed to do \u2013 accurately report your official acts and pronouncements.\",\"It is bad enough that you have shown no qualms about throwing the law, the truth and justice out the window in your headlong rush to persecute \u2013 sorry, prosecute \u2013 perceived foes of the administration.

Security officials brushed aside the claim.,In that claim, he implicated former senator Jamby Madrigal, whom he alleged tried to pay off Bilibid inmates to reverse their testimonies against De Lima; and his and the President's own party mate at PDP-Laban, Bi\u00f1an City Representative Marlyn Alonte.

Residents of Marawi City fleeing the armed clashes between government forces and the Maute Group arrive in Iligan on May 24, 2017. Photo by Bobby Lagsa/Rappler  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 President Rodrigo Duterte made good on a year's worth of pronouncements when on Tuesday, May 23, he used his constitutional power as commander in chief and declared martial law in the entire island of Mindanao.,It followed the ,crisis, in Marawi City when the military launched a strike against targets from ,ISIS sympathizers and terror group Maute, Tuesday afternoon.,The military offensive set off a chain of violence when Maute members launched their own attacks that continue until Thursday, May 25. (READ: ,Duterte confirms Maute terror group's ISIS links,),Here are questions you need to ask to know about this localized coverage of martial law:,1. ,Was it justified?,There are two grounds for the President to declare martial law.,Section 18, Article VII of the ,1987 Constitution, states: ,\"In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law.\",Christian Monsod, one of the framers of the 1987 Constitution, had said in various media interviews that the situation in Marawi City does not qualify as rebellion.,\"It doesn't look as if it's a rebellion under Section 134 of the ,Revised Penal Code,. The President certainly can call the armed forces to suppress or prevent lawless violence, this sounds like lawless violence to me, not rebellion,\" Monsod said in ,an interview on GMA News TV's News To Go, on Wednesday.,Section 134 defines rebellion as \"a, crime committed by rising publicly and taking arms against the Government for the purpose of removing from the allegiance to said Government or its laws, the territory of the Philippine Islands or any part thereof, of any body of land, naval or other armed forces, depriving the Chief Executive or the Legislature, wholly or partially, of any of their powers or prerogatives.\",\"From what I hear, Marawi is still under the control of the local government and the military is well-positioned there to address any kind of violence and terrorism,\" Monsod said. (READ: ,Martial Law 101: Things you should know,),2. Why the whole Mindanao?,Lawyer and political analyst Tony La ,Vi\u00f1a said there is basis to declare martial law but only in Marawi City where the local executives can no longer function.,\"In Marawi, I think it is necessary to give the military the control over the city but why would you do it, say, in Cagayan de Oro, when it's not necessary?\" La ,Vi\u00f1a told Rappler in a telephone interview.,The danger here, according to ,La ,Vi\u00f1a, is that it opens the possibility of a military officer taking control of other provinces in Mindanao which are not facing the same threats to public safety as Marawi. When that happens, a military officer will be entrusted with the responsibility to run a city, its politics, its businesses and its day-to-day operations with constituents despite the lack of qualifications for it.,Duterte had also categorically announced the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, which, in essence, means ,the state, subject to restrictions specified in the Constitution, can arrest anyone without warrant and jail anyone without trial in Mindanao.,While the suspension of the privilege of the writ may help the military catch rebels in Marawi City, La ,Vi\u00f1a questions whether the same is necessary for other provinces in Mindanao.,For ,La ,Vi\u00f1a, martial law is only necessary when the civilian authorities can no longer govern. It may be the case for Marawi City, ,La ,Vi\u00f1a said, but it's definitely not the case in other Mindanao provinces where their local governments are fully-functioning.,A CALL TO THE PRESIDENT. Groups opposing President Rodrigo Duterte's declaration of Martial Law in Mindanao stage a candle lighting protest in Manila on May 24, 2017. Photo by Rob Reyes/Rappler ,3. What happens to local governments?,The 1987 Constitution, crafted in the aftermath of the almost 10-year Martial Law rule under the late former president Ferdinand Marcos, made sure that the president's powers were limited.,\"There's still the bill of rights, the civilian courts, it says you cannot abolish Congress. But the most worrisome is that the law is silent on the role of local executives,\" ,La ,Vi\u00f1a said.,When then president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared martial law in Maguindanao in December 2009 after the massacre that killed 58 individuals, there were reports that an army officer would take on the role of governor to replace Andal Ampatuan Sr.,This was necessary, according to ,La ,Vi\u00f1a, because Maguindanao's leaders, including the governor, were suspects in the massacre, if not, related to the suspects.,But what happens in this context?,Political Science professor Arjan Aguirre of Ateneo said local chief executives \u2013 barangay captains, mayors, and governors \u2013 would ,have to yield, majority of their powers to the national government.,4. What can and can't the army do?,Lawyer Darwin Angeles told Rappler that a warrantless arrest is only valid if 3 criteria are met:,The ,Department of National Defense, (DND) has already issued a reminder for the military that \"a,ny arrest, search, and seizure executed or implemented in the area or place where martial law is effective, including the filing of charges, should comply with the Revised Rules of Court and applicable jurisprudence.\",This is because even though the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is supended,, the 1987 Constitution, learning from the Marcos era, made sure that the bill of rights remains in place.,An army officer can arrest and detain a person without court order on the grounds above, but he should make sure that the person is judicially charged within 3 days, otherwise, he or she shall be set free. ,It means the suspension is valid only within those 3 days to cope with the urgency of the situation, but due process following court procedures still has to be followed after that.,It is also important to remember, ,La ,Vi\u00f1a said, that the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus applies only to crimes and offenses \"inherent in or directly connected\" to invasion or rebellion.,If the crime you are accused of does not have anything to do with invasion or rebellion, regular procedures follow.,5. What happens to Proclamation 55?,After the bombing in Davao City in September 2016, which was followed by central Manila being put on high alert, Duterte ,issued Proclamation 55, or a declaration of a state of national emergency on account of lawless violence.,Under the proclamation, Duterte called on the military and the police to ,\"undertake such measures as may be permitted by the Constitution and existing laws to suppress any and all forms of lawless violence in Mindanao and to prevent such lawless violence from spreading and escalating elsewhere in the Philippines with due regard to the fundamental civil and political rights of our citizens.\",Duterte has not lifted Proclamation 55 to this day.,Can they overlap? ,La ,Vi\u00f1a said yes.,\"Proclamation 55 did not have a legal effect, it was a declaration of a state, it did not create any new power, at most it gave the President the power to designate to the army the duties which ordinarily belong to the police,\" ,La ,Vi\u00f1a.,He added: \"Proclamation 55 is now considered superseded and in fact they can now say that the proclamation did not work before and so they're declaring martial law now.\",6. Who will have the last say?,One thing's for sure now, Mindanao is under martial law for at least the next 60 days beginning Tuesday, unless Duterte or the Congress revokes it.,Duterte has first move on everything. He either lifts it before the 60-day period is over or he extends it after that, subject to the approval of Congress.,If Congress revokes it, then it's over. The Constitution is clear that \"such ,revocation shall not be set aside by the President.\",If Congress decides to extend it, they determine for how long.,While this process is ongoing, any Filipino citizen can run to the Supreme Court (SC) to question the factual basis of the martial law declaration. The SC is mandated by the Constitution to review the declaration on the basis of such petition and issue its decision within 30 days.,\"From a legal point of view, SC has the final say,\" La ,Vi\u00f1a said.,Upon arriving home from Russia late Wednesday afternoon, Duterte said ,he ,may expand, martial law to Luzon and the Visayas if the threat of ISIS persists., ,With that looming over the country, it will do us good to start to persistently ask these questions now. , ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/170917-questions-martial-law-mindanao-justification-details", "title": "Questions you need to ask about martial law in Mindanao"},

Photo by AFP/Ho/Al-Furqan Media,BAGHDAD, Iraq \u2013 Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the enigmatic self-proclaimed \"caliph\" of a state straddling Iraq and Syria, is increasingly seen as more powerful than Al-Qaeda's chief.,The leader of the powerful Islamic State (IS) militant group was on June 29 declared \"caliph\" in an attempt to revive a system of rule that ended nearly 100 years ago with the fall of the Ottoman Empire.,In a video posted online on Saturday, July 5, purportedly the first known footage of Baghdadi, he ordered Muslims to obey him during a Ramadan sermon delivered at a mosque in the northern militant-held Iraqi city of Mosul.,\"I am the wali (leader) who presides over you, though I am not the best of you, so if you see that I am right, assist me,\" he said, wearing a black turban and robe.,\"If you see that I am wrong, advise me and put me on the right track, and obey me as long as I obey God.\",The man now touted as the world's most prominent jihadist, who has rarely been seen in public, appeared in Saturday's video sporting a long beard, bushier and greyer than in the few previously released images.,His appearance follows the June 29 declaration by IS spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani of a pan-Islamic \"caliphate\" with Baghdadi as its leader.,Baghdadi, born in Samarra in 1971 according to Washington, apparently joined the insurgency that erupted shortly after the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, at one point spending time in an American military prison in the country.,In October 2005, American forces said they believed they had killed \"Abu Dua\", one of Baghdadi's known aliases, in a strike on the Iraq-Syria border.,$10-million bounty ,But that appears to have been incorrect, as he took the reins of what was then known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) in May 2010 after two of its chiefs were killed in a US-Iraqi raid.,Since then, details about him have slowly trickled out.,In October 2011, the US Treasury designated him as a \"terrorist\", and there is now a $10-million (7.3-million-euro) bounty for his capture.,This year, Iraq released a picture they said was of Baghdadi, the first from an official source, depicting a balding, bearded man in a suit and tie.,US officials said last year that the jihadist was probably in Syria, but information about his whereabouts since has been unclear.,If authenticated, Saturday's video would indicate growing confidence of the once secretive Baghdadi, one of the world's most wanted militants.,His appearance at the Mosul minbar, or pulpit, in the typical garb of a Sunni Muslim scholar, could also signal a shift from the battlefield to a more spiritual role for the self-proclaimed \"caliph\".,Baghdadi, whose group advocates an extreme form of Islamic law and a return to the lifestyle of the first Muslims, pulled out a \"miswak\" -- a twig used as a traditional toothbrush and reportedly used by the Prophet Mohammed -- and cleaned his teeth before beginning his sermon.,He is touted within IS as a battlefield commander and tactician, a crucial distinction compared with Al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri, and has attracted legions of foreign fighters, with estimates in the thousands.,At the time Baghdadi took over the group in April 2010, when it was ISI and tied to Al-Qaeda, it appeared to be on the ropes after the \"surge\" of US forces combined with the shifting allegiances of Sunni tribesmen to deal him a blow.,But the group bounced back, expanding into Syria in 2013.,Baghdadi sought to merge with Al-Qaeda's Syrian franchise, Al-Nusra Front, which rejected the deal, and the two groups have mostly operated separately since.  ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/middle-east/62498-baghdadi-self-proclaimed-caliph-islamic-state-jihadist-group", "title": "Who is Caliph Ibrahim, the chief of the Islamic State jihadist group?"},

Bin Laden was killed in a raid in Abottabad, Pakistan on May 2, 2011. AFP PHOTO/FILES,MANILA, Philippines - Afghanistan may well hold the key for Al-Qaeda\u2019s past and its future.,When US navy seals killed Osama bin Laden a year ago, they discovered a treasure trove of documents that outlined Al-Qaeda\u2019s priorities. US officials told Rappler that among the previously undisclosed documents was a paper by bin Laden\u2019s successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, laying out a strategy for Afghanistan after the United States withdraws its troops.,Exactly one year after bin Laden\u2019s death, US President Barack Obama did a stealth visit to Afghanistan and addressed Americans, highlighting the importance this ravaged nation is playing in the global fight against terrorism.,After the decade long Soviet-Afghan war ended in 1989, the Soviets and the US withdrew their forces creating a power vacuum that was filled by mujahideens recruited by bin Laden for a global jihad. ,Afghanistan became the crucible of al-Qaeda\u2019s virulent ideology and tactics which spread globally. Now with the withdrawal of 22,000 US troops in September, analysts warned it may well play that role again in the future.,\u201cAl-Qaeda and the Taliban will return to Afghanistan so we will see greater instability in another year\u2019s time,\u201d said Rohan Gunaratna, author of ,Inside al-Qaeda, and the head of the International Centre for Political Violence & Terrorism Research in Singapore.,Two weeks ago, the Taliban launched a coordinated attack on Western embassies, NATO headquarters and Afghan government facilities in Kabul and 3 eastern provinces. ,Analysts said the dramatic 18-hour assault was meant to push Afghans to align with the Taliban or risk being on the losing side when 130,000 foreign troops, led by the Americans, complete their withdrawal scheduled for 2014.,\u201cWe\u2019re only going to see an increase in these attacks,\u201d said Dipankar Banerjee, founding director of New Delhi\u2019s Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies.  \u201cIt helps [the militants] ensure political dominance in the new order as they slowly take over.\u201d,Before dawn on Wednesday, May 2, Mr. Obama addressed the American people from Bagram Airbase and announced his agreement with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. He pledged American support for Afghanistan for 10 years after the withdrawal of the last American soldiers at the end of 2014, an attempt to end US involvement responsibly. ,Symbol, not substance,That\u2019s not enough, according to critics, who said the agreement is more symbol than substance, necessary for Obama\u2019s re-election battle in November. His visit to Afghanistan comes just 4 days before two big campaign rallies kick off his political campaign.  Part of his past promises include winding down two costly and unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.,\u201cWe are not coming close to the end of al-Qaeda,\u201d Gunaratna told Rappler.  \u201cIt\u2019s a huge mistake to pander to popular opinion because the people do not know the threat.\u201d,Although al-Qaeda\u2019s core group has largely been decimated in the last 11 years, its ideology continues to spread \u2013 spawning a social movement that\u2019s using regional conflicts, including in Iraq, Afghanistan, North Africa, Yemen and Southeast Asia, to drive its growth.,Although command central is heavily degraded, the social networks remain, and more groups continue to join. Just two months ago, al-Shabab, a militant group in Somalia, formally joined al-Qaeda, swearing an oath to its new leader, Egyptian Ayman al-Zawahiri.,This week, US authorities warned al-Qaeda\u2019s Yemeni affiliate, AQAP (al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula), may try to bomb US-bound airplanes with explosives hidden in the bodies of terrorists. Experts said AQAP\u2019s master bomb-maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, has been working on body bombs \u2013 surgically planted explosives in the stomach or rectal cavity.,AQAP was involved in the most recent major attacks on US targets: the \u201cunderwear bomb\u201d used in an attempt to take down Northwest flight 253 in 2009 and the \u201cprinter bombs\u201d in the failed cargo bomb plot in 2010.,A power vacuum in Afghanistan that would give groups like AQAP and other al-Qaeda affiliates a safe haven to train and plot would repeat what happened in 1989 \u2013 a power vacuum that gave birth to al-Qaeda. ,\u201cWhat happened was Afghanistan crumbled, and it became a safe haven,\u201d said Gunaratna. \u201cSo the same thing is likely to happen \u2013 unless the international community, especially the Western nations that have the discipline and the resources, remain committed to the security and stability of Afghanistan.\u201d - ,Rappler.com,Watch Rappler's full interview with Rohan Gunaratna, author of ,Inside al-Qaeda ,here.", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/world/4663-al-qaeda-afghanistan-1-year-after-bin-laden-s-death", "title": "Al-Qaeda and Afghanistan: 1 year after bin Laden's death"},

Foto: Facebook,JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2013 Takdir Inter Milan memiliki \u201cpola\u201d. Klub berjuluk ,Nerazzurri ,itu akan mengalami masa-masa kegelapan cukup lama setelah era penuh dominasi. Setelah tahun-tahun bergelimang gelar bersama Jose Mourinho, agaknya awan gelap mulai menggantung di langit-langit Giuseppe Meazza, markas mereka.,Di masa lalu, klub berjuluk ,Le Beneamata ,itu begitu dominan di bawah ,allenatore ,(pelatih) asal Argentina Helenio Herrera. Pelatih yang memoles Inter pada 1960-1968 itu mempersembahkan tiga ,scudetto ,alias gelar Serie A, dua Piala Eropa, dan dua Piala Intercontinental yang kini bernama Piala Dunia Antarklub.,Sepeninggal Herrera, 37 tahun lamanya Inter berada di masa kegelapan. Mereka hanya meraih tiga ,scudetto,, dua Coppa Italia, dan satu Piala UEFA.,Dengan rentang waktu hampir empat dekade tersebut, raihan gelar tersebut terasa begitu kontras dengan 9 piala yang dipersembahkan Herrera hanya dalam waktu 8 tahun.,Ada kekhawatiran, era tersebut bakal kembali terulang. Sebab, sejak era Roberto Mancini pada 2004-2008 kemudian berlanjut ke Mourinho pada 2008-2010 berakhir, Inter tak kunjung meraih ,scudetto,.,Sepanjang lima musim setelah era penuh dominasi itu mereka hanya meraih satu gelar Coppa Italia.,Padahal, di masa dua pelatih tersebut, mereka meraih 12 gelar. Yakni, lima ,scudetto,, tiga Coppa Italia, tiga Piala Super Italia, dan satu gelar Liga Champions.,Puncak dari masa kejayaan Inter ada pada musim pemungkas Mourinho. Tim biru-hitam meraih ,treble winners ,alias tiga gelar dalam semusim: juara Serie A, Liga Champions, dan Coppa Italia. Prestasi yang kini tak satupun tim Serie A bisa melakukannya.  ,Masalahnya, setelah itu Inter mengalami puasa gelar. Dan belum ada tanda-tanda bakal \u201cberbuka\u201d. Kembalinya Roberto Mancini ke Giuseppe Meazza sejak musim lalu belum menunjukkan tanda-tanda ke arah sana.,Musim ini, mantan manajer Manchester City itu memang sempat membawa Inter menjadi ,capolista ,alias pemuncak klasemen Serie A. Tapi, hanya bertahan selama lima pekan. Setelah itu, tiga kali tanpa kemenangan membuat mereka ,drop ,di posisi keempat. Jarak mereka dengan penguasa klasemen, Napoli, juga terus menjauh. Enam poin!,Perburuan gelar Serie A semakin sulit bagi Inter karena musuh lama mulai pulih mentalnya. Juventus terus meraih ,streak ,(kemenangan beruntun) dalam 11 laga berturut-turut. Mereka tak terhentikan.,Inter pun harus mulai realistis. Setidaknya mengejar gelar yang berada dalam jangkauan demi menepis mendung yang menyelimuti takdir mereka. Jika tidak, mereka terancam terpuruk dalam era kegelapan yang panjang.,Karena itu, dalam laga semifinal Coppa Italia melawan Juventus, Kamis 28 Januari pukul 02.45 WIB dini hari di Juventus Stadium, Mauro Icardi dan kawan-kawan tidak boleh kalah atas tuan rumah. Hasil seri atau kemenangan bakal meringankan upaya mereka di leg kedua yang akan digelar di Giuseppe Meazza.,Allegri tak terlalu ngotot melawan Inter,Bentrok kedua klub memang memiliki tradisi kuat di sepak bola Italia. Bahkan, pertemuan keduanya dilabeli sebagai ,Derby d\u2019Italia ,alias derby Italia karena ketatnya perburuan gelar di antara keduanya.,Namun, kubu Juventus tampaknya tidak akan menganggap penting pertandingan tersebut. Mereka lebih memprioritaskan Serie A. Apalagi, selisih poin mereka dengan Napoli hanya terpaut dua poin.,Hal itu terlihat dari upaya ,allenatore ,Juve Massimiliano Allegri untuk menyimpan beberapa pemain kunci. Mereka antara lain, Leonardo Bonucci, Sami Khedira, Paul Pogba, dan Paulo Dybala.,Salah satu alasan Allegri, para pemain tersebut sudah bekerja sangat keras saat mengatasi AS Roma 1-0 pada 25 Januari lalu. Mereka layak mendapatkan istirahat ekstra. \u201c,Recovery ,pemain lebih penting daripada laga ini,\u201d katanya seperti dikutip ,Gazzetta World,. ,Mantan pelatih AC Milan itu menyadari, tim tamu lebih ngotot dalam pertandingan ini. Dia sudah menyiapkan para pelapis untuk menyambut mereka. \u201cKami akan bermain lebih terbuka dan lepas. Kami juga ingin sampai ke final,\u201d katanya.,Beberapa pemain cadangan yang akan dipasang kemungkinan adalah kiper kedua Neto, ,winger ,Alex Sandro, dan Kwadwo Asamoah yang akan menggantikan Paul Pogba. Sementara, Hernanes akan dipasang menggantikan Claudio Marchisio sebagai motor serangan di lini tengah.,Sebaliknya, Roberto Mancini tetap akan memasang pemain andalannya. Dia menargetkan hasil baik demi lolos ke partai puncak Coppa Italia.,\u201cKami harus melihat ini sebagai pertandingan yang digelar 180 menit. Sebab, setelah ini ada laga kedua. Kami harus mengatasi mereka,\u201d katanya seperti dikutip ,situs resmi Juventus,. ,Untungnya, tidak banyak pemain Inter yang mengalami cedera. Hampir semua pasukannya dalam kondisi 100 persen. Trio barisan penyerang Adem Ljajic, Rodrigo Palacio, dan Ivan Perisic bisa diturunkan dalam formasi 4-3-3. Mauro Icardi kemungkinan bakal absen karena sedang tidak akur dengan Mancini. ,Masalahnya, performa Inter sedang menurun. Mereka tak pernah menang dalam 3 pertandingan terakhir. Bahkan, di ,giornata ,(pekan) ke-21 lalu, mereka ditahan imbang 1-1 oleh tim di zona degradasi Carpi.,\u201cSaatnya kami menyingsingkan lengan baju dan bertarung.

Navotas continues to find solutions to persistent flooding. Photo by Rappler/John Javellana,MANILA, Philippines -,The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) - through a P3-B loan from the Japanese International Cooperation Agency - devised a flood control project that was envisoned to mitigate flooding in the cities of Caloocan, Malabon, and Navotas (Camanava). ,Local government officials said they were not consulted on the significant aspects of the project, however. (,Check the timeline of the project here,),They saw the biggest irony -  that the project was made for them and their people, but they were allegedly left out of the process. The costs are dire, as the project suffered from infirmities that experts warned may affect the effectiveness of the flood control project which took almost 10 years to be completed. (Watch: ,Sinking Cities,) ,Purple Romero reports:,At the height of the southwest monsoon in August 2012, this 20-year-old riverwall in Malabon collapsed.,It could have been avoided, if the right flood control project was put in place 13 years earlier in the flood-prone cities of Caloocan, Malabon, and Navotas. ,Local government units were kept in the dark for most of the years the project was being developed.  ,Navotas Rep. Toby Tiangco, who used to be mayor, says the lack of consultation led to a project with faulty design.,Former Navotas Mayor Toby Tiangco: This is Malabon-Navotas river, there is Manila Bay. If you\u2019re going to look at the map, this is Malabon-Navotas river, that is Manila Bay. So since we\u2019re below sea-level, the water comes from two sides - from Malabon-Navotas river, Manila Bay),So if you want to protect Navotas from the high tide, what do you do? You have to put a riverwall or a dike in Malabon-Navotas river and Manila Bay, because if you only put a riverwall at one side only, water will come from the other side.,Tiangco says the original design included a coastal dike.,Tiangco: In the original design of the Camanava flood project, aside from the one to be constructed at the Malabon-Navotas side, there was also a coastal dike to be built by Manila bay. But when they implemented the project, they removed the coastal dike because of lack of budget. They informed us, we complained but there\u2019s no budget. If there\u2019s no budget, what can you do?  ,By 2008, the project was way behind schedule.,The city government of Malabon asked the DPWH for copies of the contract and design of the project. ,Ed Bautista, Malabon City Engineer: ,We were given a copy of the design after the project was done. How can we say if the design is right? But we think that being stakeholders, we should be provided with this information. ,The project has 26 components. ,Work started in 2003.  ,It was supposed to be finished in 2007, but by 2008, only 88% was completed. ,DPWH project manager Carla Bartolo blames the delay on the difficulty of expropriating properties and removing informal settlers.,Camanava DPWH project manager Carla Bartolo: The delay of the project was due to right-of-way acquisition. That\u2019s the main cause of the delay. ,The DPWH was supposed to expropriate 308 lots. ,By 2009, it had paid for only 176. ,To date, around P20-million worth of properties have yet to to be paid for.,Bartolo: That\u2019s the thing - we negotiate with them, they agree [to] our terms, then they change their minds. I don\u2019t know for what reason, so we expropriate their properties. We have paid most of the property owners. There are only a few left who have yet to be paid. We first negotiated, then they changed their minds. ,Most them have already been paid. Only a few were left. First they negotiated, then they changed their minds. We only have to pay less than P20 million. ,The incomplete expropriation of properties proved costly. ,Because of unresolved right-of-way problems, several components were dropped from the original contract:,By 2008, the affected local governments insisted on their stake in the project.,Then Malabon Mayor Canuto Oreta formed an advisory council that would monitor and check why the flood control project remained unfinished.,The council found that parts of the project design were flawed.,The navigational gate -- which is supposed to control the sea water coming from Manila Bay and the outgoing water from the Navotas-Malabon river -- failed to operate in its test run in 2008. ,Bartolo blames it on the 4-meter debris that clogged the base. ,Then DPWH Secretary Hermogenes Ebdane said it was just a \"glitch.\" ,The gate was actually corroded \u2013 the link rods, brackets, and detached bolts were damaged. ,Bartolo herself reported this to the Kamanava committee, but only in February 2012 \u2013 4 years after the disastrous test run. ,Malabon initially planned to sue the DPWH in 2010. ,Engr. Benjamim Villacorta, acting city administrator, said the DPWH violated the Local Government Code when it did not inform the LGU of the status of the project.,The Malabon city government says the national government also violated Republic Act 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials when it failed to release the documents requested by the local government within 15 days.,A legal case would have been complicated, so the local governments constructed their own flood mitigating structures. ,They used their own funds.,They simply couldn\u2019t trust the unfinished national government project. ,Tiangco: In my early years as mayor, from 2001-2002, I saw that the project is already delayed. So what we did was we put up riverwalls. ,Despite the complaints over the first phase of the flood control project, the DPWH is set to start with phase 2.,This time, it\u2019s for the city of Valenzuela in Metro Manila and the towns of Obando and Meycauyan in Bulacan.,Malabon sent to DPWH a list of improvements for the Camanava flood control project. These included the upgrade of the elevation of polder dike, Catmon creek rehabilitation, rehabilitation of riverwalls and construction of pumping station and floodgates.,The DPWH is not even certain the project can withstand the effects of extreme weather or climate change.,Its officials wash its hands of responsibility and blames the designers.,Bartolo: It's our consultant who did. We're not designers - the consultants did, but I think they considered it. They pegged the project for 2020 land use. ,In fact, Camanava officials fear that the design of the project is not only faulty, it has become obsolete. ,Bautista: After Habagat, Camanava was severely underwater. Congressman Jay Lacson requested an audience with [current DPWH] Secretary [Rogelio] Singson. He himself was convinced, he confirmed that there were lapses in the design. They are amenable that we can experience such calamity with a 20-year floos-return period. But imagine [what] Ondoy was in 2009, then 3 years after, we had Habagat. So the design is now obsolete. ,For 13 years, local officials demanded the truth about the Camanava flood control project. ,When they finally got it, it was too late. - ,Rappler.com ", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/24888-camanava-flood-control-our-problem,-not-our-solution", "title": "Flood control: Our problem, not our solution"},

Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 After having made its name as a developer of high-end high-rises, Antonio-led Century Properties Group Incorporated is now diving headfirst into the affordable housing market.,\"The income recognition cycle of affordable housing is much faster than [high-end developments] so in the next few years we hope to produce 20,000 units every year. We're ramping up our production and we will stabilize at 20,000 affordable homes annually by 2020,\" said Century Properties chairman Jose EB Antonio at the firm's annual stockholders' meeting on Thursday, June 29.,\"It's a big number but if you look at the big picture for housing in the Philippines for that segment, there's a big gap between demand and supply. Looking forward, we want affordable housing to be 35% of our total income,\" he added.,Citing government figures, Antonio said there is currently a backlog of 5 million new homes. \"The whole industry ... doesn't even approach 500,000 houses in the affordable segment per year. So the industry has a lot of upside,\" he explained.,Antonio also noted that the \"increasing purchasing power\" of the middle class is key.,The sweet spot that Century Properties is aiming for is between P1.1 million and P1.8 million, with an average house and lot size of 45 square meters (sqm).,The firm already started down that path earlier this year with the launch of the first phase of its P4.5-billion ,Phirst Park Homes, housing project, in partnership with Mitsubishi Corporation.The first phase entails approximately 2,877 homes in a 26-hectare community in Tanza, Cavite.,Beyond this, Antonio said Century Properties is building up its land bank, targeting areas outside Metro Manila such as Batangas, Laguna, and other parts of Cavite.,The houses to be built on these lands will be a mix of prefabricated and conventional houses, also to be developed in partnership with Mitsubishi Corporation, which is providing technology and technical know-how.,Century Properties also won't necessarily have to set up in-house financing in order to bring in customers.,\"At the present moment there is ample credit being provided by the banking system and one of the sectors they want to increase loans to is the affordable housing market. If you think about it, it's stable because owning a house is something people really save for. The Pag-IBIG Fund will also help,\" Antonio said.,Part of a larger plan,Century Properties' move into the affordable housing space is part of its larger plan to transform itself into a multiplatform real estate company.,Last year, the firm turned cashflow positive for the first time since its 2012 initial public offering, while net cash provided by operations improved by P1.26 billion in 2016 from 2015.,Total revenues amounted to P7.38 billion from P10.38 billion in 2015 while real estate sales amounted to P4.97 billion from P7.75 billion as revenues have already been recognized in prior years from project completions, and there were fewer launches of new condominium projects in 2016.,Leasing revenues amounted to P337.85 million, 8% higher than the previous year, with net income coming in at P726.93 million.,Century Properties has also launched 33 buildings with gross floor area totaling 1.43 million sqm, to go along with its 16 buildings already completed with a gross floor area of 792,000 sqm as of end-2016.,For 2017, the firm plans to spend around P5 billion for condominium projects with an additional P1 billion set aside for leasing assets.,Besides the launch of its housing project in Cavite, Century Properties also partnered with ,Indonesian conglomerate Bakrie, in May, which will see it provide land and develop 3 mixed-use themed developments. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/business/174294-century-properties-affordable-housing-market", "title": "Century Properties sets sights on affordable housing market"},

The script envisioned a strong quake that causes a major power outage, collapsed houses, buildings, cellular and phone networks, damaged hospitals, and impassable roads, among others. It is a dreadful nightmare, as relief, recovery and rehabilitation can take years.,According to a 2012 Facebook post of Dr Jerry Velasquez, chief of advocacy and outreach, and regional coordinator of the United Nations (UN) International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, the script was taken from the Metropolitan Manila Earthquake Impact Reduction Study (MMEIRS) final report, and was developed by Lynn Paladio-Melosantos of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.   ,The 2004 MMEIRS study was conducted to have plans and strategies in place, should there be a strong earthquake that rocks the metropolis.,Velasquez highlights the major findings of the study in his Facebook post.

Photo from PHIVOLCS,MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) \u2013 A 2004 study conducted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the ,Metro Manila Earthquake Impact Reduction Study (MMEIRS),, found that Metro Manila is due for a magnitude 7.2 earthquake that may kill as much as 34,000 people.,The last time Metro Manila was struck by an earthquake of that intensity was on August 2, 1968 \u2013 exactly 48 years to this day, August 2, 2016.,Let\u2019s look back at one of the most destructive earthquakes to hit the metropolis, which caused the collapse of buildings, killing hundreds of people.,At around 4 am on August 2, 1968, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake hit the city of Casiguran in Aurora province.,Though Manila is located relatively far from the epicenter, it was the national capital that suffered the brunt of the tremor.,Fall of the buildings,Ruby Tower, a 6-storey building in Binondo, Manila, was among the buildings that were severely damaged. In it were 38 commercial units and 76 residential units.,According to the ,post-disaster study conducted by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO,), much of the building collapsed. \u201cThe upper floors fell southwards while the southern end of the roof moved about 30 feet south and 10 feet east. The lower floors appeared to fall close to their plan position.\u201d,Striking at a time when most people were sleeping, massive loss of lives was inevitable.,Among the 270 people who died, 268 of them were buried alive in this building. Of the  261 injured, 260 were from the Ruby Tower as well, some of whom died later on.,The search and rescue operations involved around 6,000 volunteers. (Read: ,When an earthquake hits Metro Manila,),Now, a memorial hall stands on its location.,Another building that suffered severe damage was the Philippine Bar Association building. Based on reports, the columns on the first floor were severely crushed that the building almost collapsed.,The Old Philippine National Bank, a 6-storey H-shaped building had to be demolished because of the irreparable structural damage caused by the quake. Other buildings either suffered considerable damage or non-structural damage.,While buildings collapsed in Manila, several landslides occurred and a number of ground ruptures were seen in Casiguran.,Photos from PHIVOLCS, ,\n,What went wrong,While the epicenter was in Casiguran, Aurora, most of the collapsed buildings were in Manila.,Director Renato Solidum of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) said in a text message to Rappler that this could be attributed to the quality of buildings at the time.,\u201cThe shaking felt in Manila was relatively strong but the main reason why some buildings collapsed was poor design and construction. There was no National Building Code approved before 1972,\u201d Solidum said.,There was also no national disaster agency in 1968. The National Committee on Disaster Operation (NCDO) was established only after the Ruby Tower disaster.,Republic Act 6541, An Act to Ordain and Institute a National Building Code of the Philippines, was enacted in 1972, 4 years after the disaster happened.,Basically, the law provides guidelines and minimum standards for the construction of buildings. It includes the proper location and materials to be used, among others.,In 1977, President Ferdinand Marcos ,revised the provisions of the law, and called it the National Building Code of the Philippines.,Today, we have the institutions and measures that were sorely missing in 1968 \u2013 a disaster agency, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC); and the Building Code.

A banker of 37 years who worked in 3 continents, he has been training with Dr Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives.,Together, they have written two books: ,Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality ,and ,Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons.,Dear Dr Holmes and Mr Baer,,I am 34, married, and have two kids.,I want to know if I have a mental disorder because I get turned on by the fantasy of sharing my wife with a stranger or friend.,I love to see my wife masturbate in front me. I get super aroused. And I get so turned on when we have threesomes, especially when I share my wife with my best buddy. My wife also enjoys this a lot.,I just want to know if I have a mental illness. Please let me know. For the record, we are already separated because she fell in love with the man we had our threesomes with.,I love her. I know all that she does too, including the threesomes she still has. The difference is that I am no longer included in those threesomes. I stopped participating because they destroyed my relationship with her.,I wish I hadn\u2019t shared my fantasy of threesomes with her.,I love my wife. I don\u2019t know how I can save our relationship.  So many people will be affected if they know what happened between us. So many will be upset if they know that we are now separated and she has another man.,Plus, she wants a baby with this man. Our separation hurts me so, so much. It seems I am the only one upset about this. She behaves as if none of this matters to her.,I am trying to fix things between us to save our relationship and to make our family of 4 whole again. Also, I do not want any more stress, but my wife refuses to listen. She does not believe me.,Am I sick because I wanted to share my wife and also because I love to watch her having sex with someone else?,We\u2019ve been together for 8 years and have been separated for one year. We pretend we are still together for the kids, but I want to fix this so we can be whole again.,Please help. What should I do? I'm really suffocated. I can't breathe. It's really hard for me.,I always look back and wish this had never happened. I also blame myself for what happened.,Oh, and by the way, we had rules before we decided to make this fantasy a reality. Our rule was no love with whomever had sex with the wife.,Please help me. I'm really depressed about what has happened to us.,I love my wife and in the 8 years we were together, I had no other woman. I have been really satisfied and contented with my wife since then, and I am the kind of man who is faithful and loyal.,I hope you can give me some advice and tell me if I am sick in the head for wanting to share my wife, for wanting to watch while she has sex with others, or engaging in a threesome. ,Thank you and God bless you,,\"Carl\",---------------,Dear Carl,,Thank you for your email.,Yours is indeed a sorry tale, which calls to mind the old adage \"careful what you wish for.\" You got to live out your fantasy of a threesome and lost your wife in the process. Now you have the inevitable regrets, and realizing that you cannot turn the clock back, you want to find some solace in the notion that everything can be blamed not on you but on a mental disorder, a \"sickness\" in your head., ,Well, there's the very bad news and the not so bad news. ,First the very bad news: while threesomes are not the choice of the majority of people, there are plenty who have threesome fantasies, and as you are probably aware, quite a few who act on their fantasies. This is seldom the result of a mental disorder, merely the preference of a minority, just as peanut butter and anchovy sandwiches may be a favorite of some but are definitely not a majority choice. So there's no chance you can transfer the blame that way.,Your second line of defense is that you had a rule \u2013 no love \u2013 which your wife then broke. However, love is not something you can control like an electric light switch, and applying a rule to it does nothing to alter that reality. You cannot blame your wife for the consequences of indulging your fantasy at your request, merely because you do not like the outcome. You have reaped what you have sown \u2013 so live with it., ,If there is anything to be said in mitigation, it is the possibility that given your wife's enthusiasm for threesomes, the disaster that has befallen you just might have happened anyway, even without you persuading her to indulge your fantasy. This is the less bad news but I doubt that will be of much consolation, particularly since it is only a hypothesis that can never be proved.,Finally, there is your 3rd line of defense \u2013 you love your wife and are \"faithful and loyal.\" Frankly, this is merely self-serving. It is easy to be loving, faithful, and loyal when you are turned on by watching your wife with other men. What you should have considered before your self-indulgence was whether she would also find it as easy. Certainly, fidelity and loyalty seem rather unlikely qualities to survive when your husband asks you to sleep with other men and love, as already mentioned, is not always under our control.,It is always possible that your wife may ultimately fall out of love with her man and the threesome lifestyle, but until that comes to pass, your place is on the sidelines. ,All the best, ,JAF Baer,Illustration by Ernest Fiestan/Rappler  ,Dear Carl,,Thank you very much for your letter. , ,Allow me to expand on Mr Baer's penultimate paragraph that \"[despite your claiming love for, and utmost fidelity to your wife] certainly fidelity and loyalty seem rather unlikely qualities to survive when your husband asks you to sleep with other men.\",This is bolstered by something \u2013 and several scholars \u2013 have already written about several times: that most men would never allow (much less instigate) \"their\" women to sleep with another man. For many, jealousy (of a special kind) is a necessary component of love. Please read:,In all likelihood, your wife is not convinced that you love her as much as you claim, because not only were you not jealous about her sleeping with others, including your best friend, but you actually egged her on to do it.  ,You also mentioned that your wife \"also enjoys this a lot.\" It is true that I do not know your wife, and am, thus, not privy to her thoughts. However, in my own clinical experience, threesomes usually start out with the man wanting the threesome and the woman going along just to keep peace or to please her man. However, very often it is the woman who ends up enjoying this setup more, which seems to be exactly what happened in your case.,Finally, you rather indignantly mention that your wife now wants a baby with this man. But, Carl, this makes perfect sense if she cares for him and at the very least, if she feels safe that he cares for her as well. ,In other words, I doubt very much that your wife will return and you can once again be the \"whole family\" you were. Like you, I would be very happy to be proven wrong. ,I am sorry that, not believing in \"tips,\" I cannot give you advice on how to win your wife back. , ,Perhaps the most helpful thing I can suggest is to live by William Wordsworth's words in his, ,Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood,. For me, the ones that particularly stand out are:,\"Though nothing can bring back the hour,Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;,We will grieve not, rather find,Strength in what remains behind.\",Lastly, should you ever find another love, in addition to reveling in its joy and wonder, perhaps you can remind yourself of the lessons you learned from what is now your past love.,All the best, dearest Carl, even if your life may not seem that way at the present. ,MG Holmes,Need advice from our Two Pronged duo?

Residents of the Davao City Treatment and Rehabilitation Center for Drug Dependents listen to psychology students on April 28, 2016. Photo by Pia Ranada/Rappler  ,DAVAO CITY, Philippines \u2013 Rodrigo Duterte, the candidate I cover for elections, mentions this drug rehabilitation center so often in his speeches that I decided to take a look at it for myself.,The Davao City Treatment and Rehabilitation Center for Drug Dependents (DCTRCDD) is a 1.2-hectare compound in Barangay Bago Oshiro, around 17 kilometers away from the city center.,A mango tree laden with fruit greets me and my companions as our vehicle passes through the gates. Beside the parking area stands the cream-colored administration building. Patches of garden surround covered walkways, gazebos, one-story dormitories, a medical section, dirty kitchen area, basketball court, and a chapel.,The day I visit, the male patients are in the garden listening to a lecture by psychology students. The patients, all in blue t-shirts, are sitting in a half-circle, facing a blackboard and two students in white uniforms., ,Notnot Gabato, a nurse in the facility, shows me the \u201cmedical section,\u201d where some doctors, mostly psychologists, are at their desks. Charts, inspirational messages, and lists of rules dominate the walls.,We drop by the womens\u2019 dormitory where some patients are hanging out by the lobby, not too shy to say hello.,Their bedroom is one long room with a single row of metal double-deckers, topped by thin mattresses. The walls and ceilings show the building is old but the residents have kept it clean and orderly. A large brown poster hangs above the sink bearing a hand-written outline of the \u201cGeneral House Rules and Regulations.\u201d, ,Originally a DSWD project,The 88 patients of the rehab center are mostly shabu and marijuana addicts, says Gabato. But a number would also get high on ,vulkasil, (elastomeric sealan) or ,rugby, (contact cement). Only a few are here for injected drugs.,The center didn\u2019t actually start as Duterte\u2019s project. It was put up in 1985, 3 years before he first became mayor. It was run by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) then.,But in 2001, the DSWD turned over the facility to the Davao City government. Duterte was already serving his 4th term as mayor when he devoted P12 million of LGU funds to repairing the center, says Center Manager Gene Gulanes.,Today, the city government covers all the costs for patients.,\u201cAs of the present, free of charge ,\u2018yung lahat ng rehab, stay nila sa center ,(the rehab, their stay at the center is free of charge). Based on our calculation, the government is spending almost P17,000 to P20,000 per patient per month,\u201d says Gulanes.,That\u2019s at least P1.5 million per month just for patient care which includes social services, health and medical, education, psychiatric and psychological services, and nutrition.,They admit an average of 100 patients per year, adds Gulanes, and release an average of 100 patients annually as well. But even after release, the center still conducts \u201caftercare\u201d and follow-ups to check on how the patient is adapting to his or her old surroundings.,'Bahay Pag-asa',Gabato says there are other drug rehab centers in Davao City, but many poor families opt to admit their loved ones here because there is no charge. Private rehab facilities can be very pricey.,There are around 40 drug rehab centers, government- and NGO-run, that are ,accredited ,by the Department of Health.,Gabato says she knows of only one other center that provides free services and stay \u2013 the Quezon City Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation Center., ,Next stop for me was a rehab center for \u201cchildren in conflict with the law\u201d or CICL. ,Davao City\u2019s \u201cBahay Pag-asa Children\u2019s Village\u201d is in the same barangay as the drug rehab center and looks pretty much the same \u2013 a compound of low buildings and gardens dotted with trees, lined by walkways.,It\u2019s one of 13 such centers in the Philippines that are fully operational, according to a June 2015 ,Philippine Star, article, quoting DSWD data.,Davao City's Bahay Pag-asa began operations in 2014, two years after the passage of the ,Amended Juvenile Justice Welfare Act, (Republic Act No 10630) which asks all LGUs to put up their own such facility.,A Bahay Pag-asa is a 24-hour institution that offers short-term residential care for offenders aged 13 to 17. ,Angela Librado-Trinidad, a barangay captain and former city councilor, said Duterte had the facility built on his 7th (current) term as mayor, even if he disagrees with the amended juvenile justice law.,Duterte has always maintained that 16 and 17-year-olds should be held criminally-liable whereas the amended version of the law holds that those below 18 years old are exempt from criminal liability.,Matt, a 14-year-old resident, says he was brought to the facility 9 months ago after he was found to have raped his sister.,\u201c,Hindi ko alam ginagawa ko kasi sabog pa ako sa droga, (I didn\u2019t know what I was doing because I was high on drugs),\u201d he said about his days as a ,rugby, addict.,Asked what good the center has done for him, he said he has learned housekeeping and respect for elders.,Nineteen-year-old John has stayed in the center the longest. He was brought in when he was 15. He was caught stealing, along with his friends.,Now, he holds a TESDA certificate for welding which he obtained while in the center., ,He likes being in the center where he is charge of the kitchen. He cooks every day.,\u201c,Mas komportable dito kasi safety ka. Sa labas, maraming away, lahat mayroon, kasi freedom. Ngayon, hindi na freedom. Inutos ng panginoon kaya nandito ako,,\u201d he told me., ,(It\u2019s more comfortable here because you\u2019re safe. Outside, there are a lot of fights, there is everything, because you are free. Now, no more freedom. God commanded that I be here.) ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/rappler-blogs/131302-davao-city-drug-rehabilitation-center-bahay-pagasa", "title": "LOOK: Davao City\u2019s rehab centers for drug addicts, youth offenders"},

Martial Law victims from Northern Mindanao process their papers to claim their compensation in Cagayan De Oro City on Friday, February 7. Photo by Bobby Lagsa/Rappler,CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, Philippines \u2013 On June 9, 1983, Ofelia Palencia and her 4 children were home in Malaybalay City in Bukdinon when an encounter between the New People\u2019s Army and government troops ensued outside their house.,Later that afternoon, Ofelia, a widower, was arrested by the military and brought to an unknown camp. The following day, the military brought her back home but took his eldest son Rudy, then 19 years old. The family has not seen Rudy since.,On Friday, February 7 \u2013 exactly 31 years after the incident \u2013 the now wheelchair-bound Ofelia made her way to Cagayan de Oro to claim compensation for her son\u2019s disappearance.

The Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (JASIG) serves a protection for individuals involved in the peace talks.  ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The administration of President Rodrigo Duterte was poised to be the \u201cfriendliest\u201d with the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) given the positive developments in the peace talks. ,However, on Saturday, February 4, Duterte announced the ,termination of negotiations, after he cancelled the ceasefire with the CPP\u2019s armed wing, the New People\u2019s Army (NPA). ,The self-proclaimed \u201cleftist\u201d president tagged the people behind Asia\u2019s longest-running insurgency as \",spoiled brats,\" and the NPAs as \u201cterrorists.\u201d (READ: ,Duterte: Communist rebels are terrorists,),The obliteration of what was supposed to be a flourishing relationship reached a new low on Tuesday, February 7, when the Duterte administration terminated the ,Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees, (JASIG).,What is the JASIG anyway? How important is it in the big picture of the peace talks? Here are some highlights:,JASIG \u2018protects\u2019 people involved in peace talks,JASIG is an agreement signed by the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDF) in 1995. (FAST FACTS: ,The CPP-NPA-NDF and the Oslo talks,),It essentially guarantees the immunity and safety of individuals involved in the peace talks. ,They are subject to \u201cfree and unhindered passage\u201d across the Philippines and also outside the country in relation to their responsibilities in the negotiations. In addition, they are also immune from \u201csurveillance, harassment, search, arrest, detention, prosecution and interrogation or any other similar punitive actions.\u201d,Guaranteeing immunity and safety not only prevents untoward incidents that may jeopardize the negotiations, but also protects negotiators and consultants, among others, from any threat that may affect the way they carry out their responsibilities.,The JASIG likewise allows parties involved to freely go to their constituents on the ground to consult and discuss the terms of the peace talks. ,JASIG-protected people have \u2018safe conduct passes\u2019,Before anyone can invoke the joint agreement, they need to be identified and duly accredited by their own party first. ,Among those who can be covered by the joint agreement are negotiators, consultants, and members of staff and security of each party. They are given identification documents or the safe conduct passes. ,Aside from an identifying number, ,safe conduct passes, also bear the official seal of the issuing party and include these details: name, sex, photo, birthday and birthplace, height, hair and eyes color, distinguishing physical features, designation or duty in the negotiations, and period of validity.,In 2014, however, CPP top leaders Benito and William Tiamzon were arrested even when they were supposedly protected by the JASIG at the time. The Left claimed their arrest was a violation of the joint agreement because after talks hit a snag in 2013, no \"special notice of termination\" that would have served to lift the joint agreement was issued.,Following this, members of leftist organizations said the JASIG has turned into a \u201c,bounty list,\u201d for the government., ,2012 computer glitch, ,Then government chief negotiator in 2012, Alex Padilla, said the Tiamzons were not granted immunity because the verification process in that year failed. (READ: ,CPP chief, wife not covered by \u2018immunity',), ,During the peace talks held in the Netherlands in 2012, the file containing the names of \u201cunderground\u201d individuals protected by the JASIG was corrupted. This file supposedly included the Tiamzons. ,Only one list that included 34 members of the NDFP negotiating panel was verified and eventually covered by the joint agreement. , ,What happens now?, ,At least 20 consultants were temporarily released in August 2016 as part of the formal resumption of the peace talks \u2013 an effort of the administration to end the conflict that has claimed thousands of lives. (READ: ,WHO'S WHO: Political prisoners released for Oslo peace talks,), ,Prior to the resumption of the peace talks, the NDF has constantly called out the imprisonment of its consultants over alleged trumped-up charges. The arrested consultants, they claimed, were protected by the joint agreement. , ,As the freedom granted by the courts to some freed consultants was expiring, the Philippine government, in a ,joint statement after the 3rd round of talks,, said that it has committed to \u201cfile immediately the necessary manifestations in support\u201d of extending the temporary liberty for the duration of the peace negotiations. ,However, things now look very different as Duterte \u2013 after he declared the cancellation of the peace talks \u2013 also said he now wants to put back behind bars NDF consultants who were released., ,NDF legal consultant Edre Olalia said a legal process has to be followed before they can be put back in jail. This process involves the issuance of court orders. (READ: ,NDF: No basis to arrest released communist rebels,), ,\"Only the courts which granted them temporary liberty by virtue of cash bails can act or order whether or not they can be validly rearrested, if at all, and not by the unilateral action of the police nor the military, much less even by the mere instructions of the GRP President,\" he said on Monday, February 6.,It will also take 30 days for the termination of peace talks to take effect.

What was supposed to be a two-week visit for them has since turned into almost two years together    ,Back in 2005 and for about 10 years before, I was living in the UK, studying architecture and working 9-to-5s in different architectural practices.  I had great employers and colleagues and although I enjoyed my work, I couldn\u2019t help but feel there was something missing. There had to be more to life than walking into the same building every day, seeing the same people and doing pretty much the same things over and over again.,MEMORY. The day we met. Luang Prabang, Laos. All photos provided by Kach Medina or Jon Howe,I decided it was time for a serious change in my life, so I saved for a year, sold my car and anything else that could be sold, bought a one-way ticket and left the UK with nothing but my backpack. It was whilst travelling through Laos by motorbike with my best friend that I stumbled across this young Filipino backpacker. ,I instantly felt she was different from all of the girls I met while backpacking, and we hit it off straight away. Although we went our separate ways shortly after, we kept in touch. After two months, Kach came to visit me in Hanoi for two weeks, where I had set myself up as an English teacher. Well, two weeks has since turned into almost two years, 7 countries, many random jobs and countless stories to tell!,Whilst I traveled quite a bit as a child, with my parents working in Africa, when you travel as an adult you see things differently and it changes you \u2013 sometimes in very subtle ways, sometimes more obviously. However, when you\u2019re in a long-term relationship with someone from another country and culture, then you begin to see the differences much more clearly. ,(READ: ,10 Commandments for your next travels,),Being from the United Kingdom, you inevitably become accustomed to Western ways and of course in turn, Western women.  Having left Britain some time ago and having now been with Kach for over a year, I thought I\u2019d reflect on some of the things I\u2019ve learned being in a relationship with a Filipina and how I may have changed in the process.,Open arms. Open doors . ,In the UK, if a person, known or unknown, were to arrive at your door, for what we\u2019ll assume is some good and honest reason, then you would at first be a little suspicious. \u2018They must want something from me,\u2019 you would think, or even more sadly, \u2018What? A person? At my door? How strange!\u2019,Reunion with friends and family in Singapore ,Now, in stark contrast, if you find yourself at the front door of a Filipino and are invited inside, then you\u2019ll discover that they are some of the warmest, most welcoming people on the planet. Even before you can manage a single, socially awkward , \u2018Err, hello, so nice to meet you,\u2019 you\u2019ll already have met Mum, Dad, the grandparents and anyone else who happens to be in easy reach.,Not only that, but quite literally out of nowhere, there will appear enough food to feed a small village for a week. No, seriously it\u2019s awesome, Filipina grandmas have magic food powers!, Read her work: ,Choose your career or go travel? Why not both?,Why I'm proud of my Philippine passport ,I\u2019ll never think of breakfast the same way ever again.,British breakfast \u2013 Porridge, toast, orange juice, bacon and sausage \u2013 with beans, if you\u2019re feeling rebellious. Done!,Filipino breakfast \u2013 ,Adobo ,\u2013 Lots of meat, marinated in vinegar, soy sauce and garlic\u2026with rice!,Tocino \u2013 Pork belly (the fattiest, tastiest bit!), with sugar and salt, then fried till crispy\u2026with rice!,Food in the Philippines is incredible, it\u2019s as simple as that. One thing that shocked me, however, was the choice of breakfast food. I\u2019ve always been accustomed to one or two pieces of bacon or a juicy Cumberland sausage in the morning, but now I get mood swings if I haven\u2019t eaten half a pig and a kilo of rice by 9am! ,Ah, karaoke.,I\u2019ve always been a little partial to loudly and drunkenly screaming out Bon Jovi\u2019s \u201cLivin\u2019 on a Prayer,\u201d but since being with Kach I\u2019ve developed a sixth sense, which I have decided to call, \u2018Microphonia.\u2019 I can sense a Karaoke machine within a 20-mile radius and I\u2019m quite prepared to kill for a can of Red Horse beer and the chance to sing Pusong Bato in a bar full of random strangers!,I will never haggle like a Filipino,Growing up in Africa, I had plenty of opportunities to observe my parents negotiating down the price of everything from fruit and vegetables, to decorative woodcarvings and even (ahem) speeding tickets. So obviously some of this bargaining power must have rubbed off on me, right?,Sure, I can get a few dollars off the price of some tourist souvenirs in the market and maybe even bargain down my overnight bus ticket a little, but I\u2019m no match for Kach.,Bargain smile (and exhausted vendor!),For Kach, everything is a potential discount, matter how small. She will quite happily spend half an hour trying to negotiate 5 cents off the price of an apple and then perform a victory dance on upon completion of the deal! She never even wanted the apple. ,(READ: ,5 tips for your budget trips,),The mysterious truth,It\u2019s a well-trodden stereotype in the West that Asian women are exceptionally loving, loyal and generous to their men and this is certainly true of Filipino women (though I\u2019ve only known one!). ,However, let it be crystal clear that this is not the same as subservient; personally I want a relationship, an equal partner. It\u2019s the little things that count, like lovingly prepared home-cooked meals every day and random head massages \u2013 not because you asked or she feels she has to, but because she wants to.,Be sure not to take her for granted though. She may be extremely loving, caring and loyal, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll let you get away with being a shit boyfriend or husband. \u2018Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\u2019 does not even begin to describe an angry Filipina \u2013 You have been warned!,Kach often tells me that although many Filipinos are very patient, if you push them too far, they could really hurt you. Of course, I think she\u2019s probably just trying to scare me, but would you take that risk with the woman who watches you sleep?!,So there you have it: 5 things I\u2019ve learned after almost two incredible years together. All I can say is this \u2013 whether it be eating pork fat for breakfast, god-awful singing or embarrassing bargaining techniques, life is a whole lot more interesting this way., \u2013 Rappler.com,Jonathan Howe is the British traveler and writer behind ,twomonkeystravelgroup.com,, working his way around the world finding new and interesting ways to support a life of long-term travel.

{"author": "", "date": "2016-05-13T02:48:46+0800", "content": "\nIT experts weigh in on the hash code controversy, saying it's much ado about a procedural lapse    , ,MANILA, Philippines - Is the camp of vice-presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos making a mountain out of a molehill?,Francesca Huang of Marcos' legal team earlier claimed in a press conference that a new script was introduced into the Comelec Transparency Server stored at Pope Pius center in Manila at around 7:30 pm on May 9. Huang made a big deal out of the fact that the ,change altered the hash code of the results files,. ,She also claimed that the senator\u2019s lead over rival Leni Robredo began to \u201cerode at a rather distinctive pattern.\u201d ,It looks like what happened was nothing more than human error. ,The error lies in the failure of Comelec and Smartmatic to immediately regenerate a new hash for the results file after they had corrected a mistake in the way names with the character \u00d1 were displayed, according to Marlon Garcia of Smartmatic.,IT experts including Rappler's tech team agreed. Had Smartmatic immediately produced a new hash after the correction and before it transmitted the corrected results file, nobody would have noticed this issue.  ,'Cosmetic' change,The diagram below reconstructs ,what happened based on a briefing conducted by Comelec and Smartmatic at the Transparency server room on Thursday evening, May 12. ,It is based on a sketch made by Joben Ilagan, one of the IT experts working with Rappler to analyze the results. ,Ilagan is the founder of ,Seer Technologies,, one of Rappler's IT partners. , ,Human error,As shown in the diagram, each of the results files, according to Smartmatic's Garcia, are transmitted by the transparency and mirror servers in zip file with the hash., ,The hash is a security feature of the system. \u201cHash codes are similar to the tamper-evident labels or seals you see in day-to-day items you buy in groceries,\u201d according to Ilagan. ,\u201cManufacturers warn you not to consume an item if the seal is broken,\u201d Ilagan explained. \u201cIn software, if a file's tamper-evident seal is different from what we expect, we have reason to question the setup.\u201d,To check for the correct seal, you need to run the file and the hash through a hash validator.,Each of the workstations at Pope Pius has a hash validator where groups can check this. ,So every zipped file of election results contains folders that will show the results file and the hash for every file. ,In this particular batch of results past 7 pm of Monday, it was the second hash in the zipped file that ,showed a mismatch. ,Before this, the Rappler IT team in Pope Pius noticed the ? sign in names that contained the letter \u00d1. We notified the Comelec and Smartmatic personnel about this error, and they immediately announced to all the groups present in the server room (including media, watchdogs and accredited political parties) that the correction would be in the next batch of files.,None of the groups present, including the political parties represented, raised an objection to the correction. ,After the correction was made, the server continued to transmit results with the old hash. That's because Comelec and Smartmatic personnel forgot to regenerate a new hash results file.,Thus, ,hash files that accompanied the succeeding results files transmitted by the 2 servers to media and poll watchdog groups failed to match when they were run through a hash validator.,\"We didn't think much of it. It was not the code that was changed. It was hash of the results file. It did not affect the results, \" ,according to William Yu, IT Director of the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV)., ,Had the hash files been regenerated, the succeeding results files would have been resealed. The hash validators would not have detected any problem. And the Marcos camp would have not screamed about it.  ,OUT OF PROPORTION? The Comelec says the Marcos camp is making a big deal out of a simple 'cosmetic change' in the Transparency server results files ,Even a hash mismatch does not necessarily mean cheating, according to IT experts. A single character change, like what happened in this case, can also change the hash. ,\u201cHash codes can also change through human error or some other reason,\u201d Ilagan explained.,A lawyer of the opposition United Nationalist Alliance acknowledged that they observed the \"error\" in the hash validation from 7:30 pm of May 9 through 8 am of May 10, 2016.,\"We were validating the hash of the results file,\" according to ,Ivan Uy, lawyer for the United Nationalist Opposition (UNA).,This was reported to the Comelec and by May 10, at 8 am, a new hash was generated.,Hash demo,To demonstrate that the \u00d1 character correction is really the only part of the application that was changed, the Comelec and election automation vendor Smartmatic ,explained how results files were generated and security features of the system, including the hash to media and observers at the Transparency server room on Thursday night.,The scripts inside the server, including scheduled tasks and how the hash looked, were shown using a projector to everyone in the briefing. ,Among the groups present were some IT professionals. ,Smartmatic's Garcia explained that, for security reasons, Smartmatic and Comelec split the password to access the server into 2: one part is kept by Comelec and the other by Smartmatic.,Each time a change needs to be done, a Smartmatic representative has to input one half of the characters in the password while the other half is inputted by the authorized Comelec representative.,This means both Smartmatic and the Comelec cannot make changes to the server applications on their own. ,Garcia said it was he who corrected the \u00d1 error in the results generating script which generated results files received by accredited groups. (See timeline graphic above.) ,Garcia also said he will demonstrate how the hash changed.

It is an act of defiance, asserting that you, by yourself, mainly control who you are and who you will become. But we live in this planet with other people, encounter them in various ways and depths, all the time. How much of our encounters with others define who we are and who we become? Evidence says a lot more than we care to admit.  ,When you connect with someone, that connectedness is echoed in your heart, brain, respiration and even in the way you perceive pain. Our bodies and minds literally synch with the person you encounter and behold.,Many years ago, on separate occasions, two of my closest friends got married. Both asked me to sing exactly the same song in their own weddings: ,One Hand, One Heart, from West Side Story. Both wanted that same song which peaks with this line \u201cMake of our hearts, one heart.\u201d  I liked singing the song because I thought it was a good metaphor for two people committing to each other to entwine their lives. But Leonard Bernstein, composer of that song, probably did not know that that line was real in more ways than just metaphorical.,When you are in a romantic relationship with someone, in a world where you have to wade through a lot of muck and lot of other people, you are not a stranger or in these days, a pixel in a crowded image, to your beloved and vice versa.  Among the many things that echo this is your hearts beat at the same rate. Yes, science has found that ,lovers\u2019 heart rates synch, even when just staring at each other. Your hearts literally beat as one. This kind of synching was also found to calm lovers. It also made me think whether this is a definitive test of whether you are still in love with someone \u2013 if you no longer have this constant feeling that you are beating as one when you are alone together.,This kind of synching among lovers is also found to be true when partners touch each other.  A ,recent study, has found that when you are in pain and your beloved touches you, you feel less pain. Their heart and respiration rates synch too. This does not happen when strangers touch each other.,But \u201csynching\u201d is not limited to romantic relationships. ,Uri Hasson, is a neuroscientist who studies what happens to brains of people when they are in a conversation. He found that people have similar brain patterns as they listen to each other. The deeper or multi-faceted the exchange is, the more (deeper) brain areas are in synch. This is why when someone talks to you about their passions, their dreams, their expressions of love, you \u201cget\u201d it. It is because you literally really get it. You assume the same brain patterns as the one conveying them to you. In his talk, he even showed that this is the same when you are in the audience listening to someone tell you a story. The audience who is listening assumes the same brain patterns as the one telling the story on stage. This is also what happens when you ,watch a movie,. We all assume the same brain patterns as the filmmaker when he was doing and telling that story. This is what is also happening when you are with your friends and you are all listening to each other\u2019s stories. There is an internal humming that we all become part of but are not really conscious of.,Brain patterns are reflective of how our brain cells connect. How our brain cells connect is how we think and feel. How we think and feel is who we are and lay the path to the many selves we could become. Therefore, as Uri Hasson has shown us in his work above -  tell me who you couple with and I will tell you who you are. This is why with whom and what you spend a lot of time says a great deal about you. The kind of friends you spend the most time with, the work and team members you labor with, the teachers and mentors who guide you \u2013 they wire you , i.e., they recreate you. So while you really cannot judge a book by its cover, we can somehow judge ourselves by the people we choose to spend the most time with because they literally mess with our heart and minds.,This does not mean that the only virtue in conversation is to have it with people who think like you. On the contrary, it happens to people who are willing to engage in a dialogue \u2013 where you allow yourselves to have an exchange, including the alternating silences, that allow each of you to also listen to each other, sorting out differences. In this kind of exchange, as Hasson says, a common ground is found and the synching happens.  And it is important to note that these studies were done with people who paid close attention to each other directly. Even the ones who were watching the movie were focused on only the movie.,That is what is lost in online posting. All these wouldn\u2019t have as much gravitas if we shield ourselves from people with the tiny screens we hold in our hands even as we attempt to connect with someone.

He also ,questioned the P8.3-billion funds, for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao which was included in the DPWH budget, saying this violates the ARMM Organic Law.,During the bicameral conference committee, the House eventually gave in to Lacson's proposal. In the end, the P8.3 billion was removed from the DPWH and transferred to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for ,free tuition ,in SUCs.

The Department of Education's (DepEd's) Office of the Secretary received the highest proposed increase in funds at P135.13 billion ($2.85 billion).,With a glaring 600% budget hike, the DBM ,explained, that the Office of the President's P20.03 billion ($422.4 million) budget for 2017 includes some P15.46 billion ($326.02 million) for the 50th founding anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The Philippines will play host next year.,The budget department announced that sans the ,hosting expenses,, the financial plan for the President's offices will grow by only P1.71 billion ($27.37 million) from 2016's P2.86 billion allocation ($60.22 million).,The DBM explained that money will be used primarily for intelligence activities related to the president's war against drugs, criminals, and corruption. In the ,NEP,, the budget on oversight management on national security concerns is about P2.76 billion ($58.19 million).,Meanwhile, DepEd's suggested allocation for 2017 is pegged at P566.24 billion ($11.94 billion). It represents a 31.35% jump from this year's allocation of P431.11 billion ($9.09 billion). Half of it will go to teachers' salaries and school buildings, as outlined in the ,NEP,.,The table below shows that DepEd is followed by the Department of Public Works and Highways' Office of the Secretary budget with P61.50 billion ($1.30 billion) and the Internal Revenue Allotment at P58.27 billion ($1.23 billion) in terms of proposed increase in funds:,2017 (Proposed),[In billion  pesos],2016 (Adjusted),[In billion  pesos],Increase ,[In billion  pesos],%,DPWH received a 15.49% increase from this year's allocation of P397.11 billion ($8.37 billion). The P458.61-billion ($9.67-billion) proposed budget by the public works department will be used primarily for building road networks and flood control systems.,Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Allotment for local governments received a 13.59% increase at P486.89 billion ($10.28 billion) from 2016's P428.62-billion ($10.18 billion) allocation.,The treemap below shows the distribution of funds among agencies in the proposed financial plan. Similar to the previous years' budgets, the education sector got the lion's share of funds, while the Office of the Vice President got the smallest slice of the pie this year. (To see the 2016 and 2015 budgets, click the other tabs.),Top losers?,The Department of Health (DOH), National Housing Authority, and the Commission on Elections got the biggest cuts for 2017.,The DOH Office of the Secretary proposed a P92.97-billion ($1.96-billion) budget in 2017, or P31.09 billion ($654.37 million) less than this year's P124.06-billion ($2.61 billion) allocation.,This is not to say, however, that the budget for the health sector received the biggest cut.,The reason for the decrease in funds is attributed to the transfer of insurance premiums. In the 2016 budget, these are lodged under the National Health Insurance Program of the government. Next year, it will be transferred to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, one of the agencies with the biggest increases in funding \u2013 by P50.22 billion ($1.06 billion). (See table above),In sum, the proposed budget for the health sector is at P144.3 billion ($3.04 billion), 15.4% higher than 2016 figures.,The table below shows the top 10 agencies with the highest drop in funds in the proposed 2017 budget:,2017 (proposed),[In billion  pesos],2016 (adjusted),[In billion  pesos],Decrease,[In billion  pesos],%,-,The suggested budget for the National Housing Authority in 2017 is at P12.64 billion ($266.04 million) which is significantly lower than this year's allocation of P30.48 billion ($641.53 million).,The decrease in funds is partly due to NHA's decreased share of housing assistance program for Super Typhoon Yolanda victims. In the 2016 budget, about P25.6 billion ($538.82 million) was allotted for Yolanda reconstruction. while the amount is lowered to P1.3 billion ($27.36 million) for 2017, following the rehabilitation plan.,Next year, the bulk of the housing funds will go to the government's resettlement program for informal settler families living in danger zones.,For obvious reasons, the Comelec's share of funds is substantially lowered in 2017 as this year's budget included allocation for the national elections.,Will promised programs be funded?,The President has been very vocal about his promises, coupled with very strict deadlines.,Among those promised are the pay hike for cops and soldiers, sustaining the Conditional Cash Transfer program, and infrastructure upgrades.

He said he would like to make that commitment.\u201d,The President announced on a trip to Canada last Friday that he talked to Poe about the 2016 polls, but refused to say what \u201ccommitment\u201d he gave her.,Aquino is the chairman of the ruling Liberal Party (LP).

Poe is an independent candidate allied with the administration, and ran with the LP's Senate slate in 2013. ,Some LP members are ,pushing for a Roxas-Poe tandem, but others believe that with Poe's popularity, she will be better off as a presidential bet.,A reluctant possible candidate, Poe said the meeting with the President will help her decide on her political plans.,\u201c,It is a huge honor to have the trust of someone you respect. If ever, I won't say I have a bigger chance now but, of course, that adds to the decision I will make. But I can't say I am already sure because this is just one aspect.\u201d,Poe said much of her meeting with Aquino was \u201creading between the lines.\u201d She said he did not even directly ask her if she was open to higher office.,\u201c,This is what is clear. Aren't people asking if he is thinking about 2016? It's clear that he is. Second, it's clear that the President is thinking of someone they can support who has the trust of the people, and has the chance to push for their reforms.

In what position, I am still thinking it through.),Poe admitted that she is inexperienced, being a senator for only two years after heading the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board. In an apparent reference to Binay, she said her edge is her clean record in government.,\u201c,There are many who have been in government for a longer time, so it's not easy to decide. But I believe that despite shortcomings and things left to be done, the reform on corruption must be continued,\u201d Poe said.,Poe also addressed concerns about her perceived rift with Aquino after she issued a scathing report holding the President ultimately responsible for the January 25 Mamasapano clash. The biggest crisis to hit Aquino's administration, the clash in Maguindanao killed 67, and put the peace process in peril.,She has also criticized Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya over the poor Metro Trail Transit (MRT) services, and resigned police chief Alan Purisima over corruption. Abaya and Purisima are friends of Aquino.,Still, the senator said she and Aquino are \u201cprincipled allies.\u201d,\u201c,The mere fact he called me there means he appreciates my work.

There may be some deficiencies in any particular system, but we're here to help make it better,\u201d Poe said.,Drilon: Mar still LP bet,Poe said she talked to her close friend, Senator Francis Escudero, about the meeting with Aquino. Escudero is rumored to be running for vice president, and a possible running mate of Poe should she seek the presidency as an independent bet. ,\u201c,We're supportive of each other.

We should stop defining each other by what we are not, and start defining ourselves by who we are.\u201d,British actress Emma Watson made this call as she launched a United Nations campaign for men and boys worldwide to join the movement for gender equality. (,WATCH the full video here,.),The UN Women Global Goodwill Ambassador was at the UN Headquarters in New York on Saturday, September 20, to deliver a strong and personal message on equality, gender roles, and feminism.,\u201cI want men to take up this mantle so their daughters, sisters and mothers can be free from prejudice but also so their sons have permission to be vulnerable and human, too and in doing so, be a more true and complete version of themselves,\u201d Watson said.,The UN Women campaign called \u201cHeForShe\u201d aims to mobilize one billion men and boys as advocates of change in ending inequalities that women and girls face globally.,In the speech that earned her a standing ovation, Watson stressed the importance of men\u2019s involvement in promoting women\u2019s rights.,\u201cHow can we effect change in the world when only half of it is invited to participate in the conversation? Men, I would like to take this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too.\u201d,\u201cI\u2019ve seen my father\u2019s role as a parent being valued less by society. I\u2019ve seen young men suffering from illness, unable to ask for help for fear it will make them less of a man \u2026. I\u2019ve seen men fragile and insecure by a distorted sense of what constitutes male success. Men don\u2019t have the benefits of equality, either. We don\u2019t often talk about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes but I can see that they are.\u201d,Watson said liberating men from stereotypes ultimately benefits women.,\u201cWhen they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence. If men don\u2019t have to be aggressive in order to be accepted, women won\u2019t feel compelled to be submissive. If men don\u2019t need to control, women won\u2019t have to be controlled. Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong,\u201d she said.,The actress famously known for her role as Hermione in the ,Harry Potter ,series poked fun at being in the UN but turned serious about her advocacy. ,\u201cYou might think: who is this Harry Potter girl? What is she doing at the UN? I\u2019ve been asking myself the same thing. All I know is that I care about this problem and I want to make this better. And having seen what I\u2019ve seen and given the chance, I feel it is my responsibility to say something.\u201d,\u2018Feminism is not man-hating\u2019,Watson spoke at length about her personal experience as a feminist, and how society views the concept. The 24-year-old actress took on her role as UN Women ambassador 6 months ago. Earlier this month, she visited Uruguay to learn about women's political participation there. ,\u201cThe more I spoke about feminism, the more I realized that fighting for women\u2019s rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain is that this has to stop.\u201d,Watson said she decided to become a feminist after being called \u201cbossy\u201d for wanting to direct a play at 8, and grew up as a teenager being sexualized by the media and seeing how gender stereotypes stopped her girl friends from joining sports teams, and male friends from expressing their feelings. ,She said deciding to become a feminist was \u201cuncomplicated\u201d but she found from personal experience and her own research that feminists were viewed as \u201ctoo strong, too aggressive, anti-men, unattractive.\u201d,\u201cWhy has the word become such an uncomfortable one? I think it is right I am paid the same as my male counterparts. I think it is right that I should make decisions about my own body. I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policies and decisions that will affect my life. I think it is right that socially, I am afforded the same respect as men,\u201d she said.  ,Watson said that the notion of feminists should be expanded to include those who help girls and women achieve their full potential.,\u201cMy life is a sheer privilege because my parents didn\u2019t love me less because I was born a daughter. My school did not limit me because I was a girl. My mentors didn't assume that I would go less far because I might give birth to a child one day.These influences are the gender equality ambassadors that made me who I am today. They may not know it but they are the inadvertent feminists needed in the world today. We need more of those.\u201d,She stressed that both men and women must work together for the girls and women who are less privileged than she. She cited women who earn less than men for doing the same work, child brides, and girls who are unable to finish their education.,\u2018Wave your magic wand\u2019, ,UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka commended Watson for her work with UN Women.,Ban said in jest, \u201cShe\u2019s been waving a magic wand. I hope you use your magic wand to end violence against women!\u201d,Turning serious, he said, \u201cMen are responsible for most of the threats and violence against women. Often, these men are close to the victims \u2013 fathers, husbands, boyfriends or supervisors. We need to say to men and boys: Do not raise your hands in violence \u2013 raise your voices to stop it \u2013 and to support human rights for all.\u201d,The UN chief was counted as the \u201cnumber one man\u201d to sign up on the HeForShe map in a 12-month campaign to tally the goal of getting a billion male advocates.,CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer and ,24 ,actor Kiefer Sutherland also attended the event along with top UN officials.,Watson gave them a parting message: \u201cIn my nervousness for this speech and my moment of doubt, I told myself firmly: if not me, who? If not now, when? \u2026. I invite you to step forward, to be seen and ask yourself: if not me, who? If not now, when?\u201d,Here is a transcript of Watson\u2019s speech:,Today we are launching a campaign HeForShe. I am reaching out to you because we need your help. We must try to mobilize as many men and boys as possible to be advocates for change. We don\u2019t just want to talk about it. We want to try and make sure it\u2019s tangible. I was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women 6 months ago.,The more I spoke about feminism, the more I realized that fighting for women\u2019s rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain is that this has to stop. For the record, feminism by definition is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of political, economic and social equality of the sexes.,When I was 8, I was called bossy because I wanted to direct a play we would put on for our parents. When at 14, I started to be sexualized by certain elements of the media. At 15, my girlfriends started dropping out of sports teams because they didn\u2019t want to appear masculine. At 18, my male friends were unable to express their feelings.,I decided that I was a feminist. This seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word. Women are choosing not to identify as feminists. Apparently, [women\u2019s expression is] seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, and anti-men, unattractive even.,Why has the word become such an uncomfortable one? I think it is right I am paid the same as my male counterparts. I think it is right that I should be able to make decisions about my own body. I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policies and decisions that will affect my life. I think it is right that socially, I am afforded the same respect as men.,But sadly, I can say that there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to see these rights. No country in the world can yet say that they achieved gender equality. These rights are considered to be human rights but I am one of the lucky ones.,My life is a sheer privilege because my parents didn\u2019t love me less because I was born a daughter. My school did not limit me because I was a girl. My mentors didn't assume that I would go less far because I might give birth to a child one day. These influences are the gender equality ambassadors that made me who I am today. They may not know it but they are the inadvertent feminists needed in the world today. We need more of those., ,If you still hate the word, it is not the word that is important. It is the idea and the ambition behind it because not all women have received the same rights I have. In fact, statistically, very few have.,In 1997, Hillary Clinton made a famous speech in Beijing about women\u2019s rights. Sadly, many of the things that she wanted to change are still true today. What struck me the most was that less than 30% of the audience were male. How can we effect change in the world when only half of it is invited or being welcomed to participate in the conversation?,Men, I would like to give this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too. Because to date, I\u2019ve seen my father\u2019s role as a parent  being valued less by society. I\u2019ve seen young men suffering from mental illness, unable to ask for help for fear it would make them less of a man. In fact, in the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20 to 49, eclipsing road accidents, cancer and heart disease. I\u2019ve seen men fragile and insecure by what constitutes male success. Men don\u2019t have the benefits of equality, either.,We don\u2019t often talk about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes but I can see that they are. When they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence. If men don\u2019t have to be aggressive in order to be accepted, women won\u2019t feel compelled to be submissive. If men don\u2019t have to control, women won\u2019t have to be controlled., ,Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong. It is time that we all see gender as a spectrum instead of two sets of opposing ideals. We should stop defining each other by what we are not and start defining ourselves by who we are. We can all be freer and this is what HeForShe is about. It\u2019s about freedom. I want men to take up this mantle so that their daughters, sisters and mothers can be free from prejudice but also so that their sons have permission to be vulnerable and human too, reclaim parts of themselves they abandoned and in doing so, be a more true and complete version of themselves.,You might think: who is this Harry Potter girl? What is she doing at the UN? I\u2019ve been asking myself the same thing. All I know is that I care about this problem and I want to make it better. And having seen what I\u2019ve seen and given the chance, I feel it is my responsibility to say something. Statesman Edmund Burke said all that is need for the forces of evil to triumph is for good men and women to do nothing., ,In my nervousness for this speech and in my moments of doubt, I told myself firmly: if not me, who? If not now, when? If you cast doubts when opportunity is presented to you, I hope those words will be helpful. Because the reality is if we do nothing, it will take 75 years or maybe 100 before women can expect to be paid the same as men for the same work. 15.5 million girls will be married in the next 16 years as children. And at current rates, it won't be until 2086 before all rural African girls can have a secondary education.,If you believe in equality, you might be one of the inadvertent feminists I spoke of earlier and for this I appraud you. We must strive for a united world but the good news is we have a platform. It is called HeForShe. I invite you to step forward, to be seen and I ask yourself: if not me, who? If not now, when?

Vice President Jejomar Binay belittles all the accusations raised against him in a Senate inquiry into the allegedly overpriced Makati 'parking building.' Photo by Jose Del/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Vice President Jejomar Binay on Wednesday, August 27, belittled the allegations against him, saying that Makati even saved P200 million ($4.57 million*) on its so-called \u201cparking building\" alleged to be overpriced. ,Instead of facing a Senate investigation to answer the allegations of his critics, Binay opted to hold a press conference where he read an opening statement in the presence of his close allies, and took questions from reporters.,In the briefing at his office at the Coconut Palace in Pasay City, the former Makati mayor said the price of the 11-storey building was not P2.7 billion ($61.79 million), as claimed by Senator Antonio Trillanes IV and the ,complainants who cited a Commission on Audit (COA) memorandum,.,Binay said the estimated cost was P2.4 billion ($54.94 million) but the actual cost turned out to be only P2.2 billion ($50.36 million). The Vice President did not present documents to show this but said the city government has records that will be \u201cthe best evidence.\u201d,He said: \u201cP2.4 billion minus P2.2 billion, ,May, P200 million, pa nga ang, Makati. Ang phases ,na iyon ay nagkaroon ng, phases ,depende sa ,availability of funds. ,Ang ,estimated cost, po ay hindi, P2.7 billion, na pinalalaki nila. Ang ,estimated cost, po diyan ,was P2.4 billion., Ngayon, alam ba ninyo a,t the end of the day,, magkano po ang nagastos? ,P2.2 billion.\u201d,(P2.4 billion minus P2.2 billion. Makati even had P200 million left. The phases were done because the construction depends on the availability of funds. The estimated cost was not P2.7 billion that they are trying to balloon. The estimated cost was P2.4 billion. Now, do you know at the end of the day how much was spent? P2.2 billion.),Binay also turned the tables on his accusers, who along with COA Chairperson ,Grace Pulido-Tan questioned the building\u2019s division into 5 phases.,\u201c,Sabi mo,, according to Senator Cayetano,\u201d Binay told this reporter. \u201c,Sila mismo nagphe-,phasing, ah, baka akala mo. Sila rin nagpagawa sa kontratista namin. Hindi naman bawal iyon, in the first place, ang, phasing.\u201d,(You said, according to Senator Cayetano. They themselves do phasing, you know. They used our same contractor. In the first place, phasing is not illegal.),The Vice President was referring to Senate Majority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano, who said that Makati\u2019s phasing of the building appeared irregular because phases were added supposedly in the project without knowing the final cost. Binay maintained that the city government had P2.4 billion as the estimated cost. (READ: ,Binay: Senate probe 'badly written telenovela',),Binay\u2019s statement contradicted the stance of the COA chief who told the Senate last week that the practice of dividing projects into phases was a \u201c,red flag,.\u201d ,Why was awarding too fast?,One red flag Tan cited was the speed by which the building was awarded to the contractor, a process that only took two and a half months instead of what she said was the usual 6 months for a project of this magnitude.,A lawyer, Binay responded: \u201cJust because the project was done quickly, it doesn\u2019t mean it was questionable. It\u2019s not how long you work on it. It\u2019s the quality of time. But it was well within the period of time so provided in the law in instances like this. I think it starts from 44 calendar days to 100.\u201d,Binay's spokesman Joey Salgado later clarified that according to the Procurement Act, the procurement process from posting to award of contract covers a minimum of 28 calendar days and a maximum of 144. ,The Vice President said COA auditors and technical specialists did not make any adverse finding. \u201cCOA was there before we did every phase of construction. It was okay with them.\u201d,COA\u2019s resident auditor Cecilia Caga-anan though is a co-respondent of the Binays in the plunder case filed against them. The agency is doing a special audit on the building but Binay doubted how the COA can \u201creverse\u201d the findings of the resident auditor.,Binay and his son Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin \u201cJunjun\u201d Binay Jr are accused of overpricing the so-called parking building known as the Makati City Hall Building 2 by almost P2 billion ($45.80 million). They are the subjects of the Senate inquiry and a ,plunder complaint before the Ombudsman, over the issue.,The building was first constructed in 2007, when the elder Binay was mayor, and was finished in 2013 when his son took over.,Binay is the leading candidate for the 2016 presidential elections, where his rivals Cayetano and Trillanes of the Nacionalista Party (NP) are also eyeing higher office.,Contractor made Batangas property?,Binay again pointed to his critics when asked ,why Hilmarc\u2019s Construction Corporation was the contractor that won all 5 phases of the building,, and other buildings in Makati. Senators raised this as another \u201cred flag.\u201d,\u201cSiguro ho tanungin niyo rin siguro ang mga pamahalaan sa ,Iloilo Convention Center,, sa ,Taguig.Hilmarc\u2019s, din ang gumawa noon.\u201d ,(Maybe you should also ask other government units like Iloilo Convention Center, in Taguig. Hilmarc\u2019s was also the contractor.),The Iloilo Convention Center is a pet project of Senate President Franklin Drilon of the ruling Liberal Party (LP).,Binay just echoed the statement of his son that Hilmarc's won the bidding. \u201cBoss,, may proseso iyon. ,Either, may nag-bid, may nanalo sa ,bidding,, pero hindi porque siya nanalo, hindi nagkaroon ng tamang proseso, (Boss, there\u2019s a process there. Either someone bid and won the bidding but just because the contractor won, it doesn\u2019t mean it did not pass through the proper process).\",Binay dismissed the press statement of lawyer Renato Bondal that Hilmarc's was Makati\u2019s \u201cfavorite contractor\u201d because it supposedly constructed houses and farm facilities in a property owned by the Binays in Batangas, where the Vice President hails from.,\u201cAh hindi ko alam iyan eh at I think iyon hong pagiging ,favorite, ho doon kay ,Hilmarc, ay siya po ay nanalo ,through a process, ,(Oh, I do not know that and I think Hilmarc\u2019s being the favorite was because it won through a process).\",Binay likewise downplayed ,allegations of conflict of interest, between his son and Hilmarc's chairman of the board Efren Canlas, who is also an officer of Construction Safety Foundation, as Cayetano pointed out in the first Senate hearing.,The elder Binay said his son and Canlas were just together in the group but this did not automatically mean there was conflict of interest.,'APPLES TO APPLES.' Binay says the Makati building should not be compared to private buildings. Photo by Jonathan Vicencio/Office of the Vice President \n,\u2018Senate did no canvass\u2019,Binay also rejected the standards that the senator had used to determine that the building was overpriced. He said the value given by Cuervo Valuers & Advisory Inc was a mere \u201cmarket appraisal for a hypothetical building.\u201d,He also dismissed the Davis Langdon and Seah handbook that Cayetano waved and grilled auditors about. Binay even imitated Cayetano in waving the book.,\u201cThe handbook that Senator Cayetano is saying is not part of the process that COA follows in its study. That\u2019s not included.\u201d,To determine overpricing, Binay said the Senate should have conducted a \u201ccanvass\u201d of materials and supplies used, and do an \u201capple-to-apple\u201d comparison or compare the government building not with private structures.,\u201cNot once did the Senate do a canvass,\u201d Binay said.,Binay remained defiant, saying no case against him has prospered in court despite the numerous accusations, and long-running rumors about his family\u2019s corruption in Makati.,\u201cHanggang ngayon, wala pa silang maipakitang ebidensya na ,overpriced, ang, building., Uulitin ko: wala akong kaso sa ,Sandiganbayan (Until now, they cannot show evidence that the building was overpriced. I repeat: I have no case before the Sandiganbayan).\",Malaca\u00f1ang has, ,not outrightly defended of Binay amid the allegations, but Presidential Spokesman Edwin Lacierda said in a news briefing on Wednesday that as a member of the official family of President Benigno Aquino III, the Vice President ,still enjoys the trust and confidence of the President,., \u2013 Rappler.com, *$1 = P43.6", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/nation/67411-binay-presscon-makati-building", "title": "Binay: Makati even \u2018saved\u2019 P200M from building"},

Ending malnutrition among children is an important matter. Graphic by Raffy De Guzman ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 During his last ,State of the Nation Address, on Monday, July 27, President Benigno Aquino III failed to discuss an important facet of the country's health: nutrition.,His over-two-hour speech failed to tackle how the Philippines has fared in its fight against malnutrition under his administration, among many other issues. (READ: ,What Aquino failed to mention in his 2015 SONA,),This is actually a critical time for the country as the deadline for meeting targets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) set by the United Nations nears. The country was expected to work overtime in 2010 to 2014 to hit the targets \u2013 specifically those related to nutrition:,These targets are interconnected as one affects the other. If you reduce the problem of poverty and hunger, it is highly probable that child mortality will be reduced.,Malnutrition has caused many deaths of children under 5 years old. The health risks which are rooted in the effects of not having the right nutrients in the body are too much for a child to handle. (READ: ,Lend a hand: Help kids reach their 5th birthday,),In some cases, if these risks are not fatal, they will still carry effects \u2013 irreversible, unfortunately \u2013 through adulthood. This may hinder them from attaining their ,maximum potential in life,.,Varying covered population,The Operation Timbang Plus (OTP) of the National Nutrition Council (NNC) is a yearly operation where pre-schoolers aged 0 to 71 months old or below 6 years old are weighed. This is to identify and target the malnourished children in each community or area. (READ: ,Who is on top of nutrition?,),The results of OTP are used in the planning of local nutrition council. This paves way for much needed prioritization \u2013 especially budget appropriation and interventions \u2013 in areas with a high prevalence of malnutrition.,NNC strives to cover all children who fit in the age gap, but based on OTP results collected by Rappler, the total number of screened children under 6 years old varies from year to year.,(Note: Hover over the charts in this story to see the value of each category.),Indicated in the data are reasons behind this, including areas with no submitted report or no activity done due to \u201cinstability\u201d \u2013 such as in 2010 in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). (READ: ,How conflict can lead to food insecurity and hunger,),Decreasing trend?,According to OTP results, the prevalence of underweight and severely underweight children under 6 years old is on a downward trend in the last 5 years \u2013 save for a significant increase in 2012.,The World Health Organization (WHO) defines \"underweight\" as having body weight that is too low to be healthy. These are usually 15% to 20% below what is normal for the age and height of a child based on his or her ,Body Mass Index,.,In 2010, the prevalence of underweight children under 5 years old was at 6.43%, while severely underweight stood at 1.35%.,After 5 years, the prevalence of underweight children went down to 5.04% in 2014. Severely underweight children meanwhile increased to 1.48% \u2013 only .13% higher than in 2010.,The prevalence of severely underweight children, however, has remained steady in the last 5 years. It never reached the 2% mark but never decreased to less than 1%.,The bulk of malnourished children during the 5-year period are those underweight. In addition, there is a big difference between the number of underweight and severely underweight children, based on OTP results.,According to the latest OTP results, there are 443,883 underweight and 130,636 severely underweight children under 6 years old in 2014. This means that out of the total 8,808,792 children screened, 574,519 are suffering from undernourishment.,These are the top 10 provinces with the most number of undernourished children:,Despite the relatively decreased number, it is still high compared to other countries in Southeast Asia. And while the number of ,hungry Filipinos hit an all time low in 10 years,, it still took 10 years to achieve this.,Legislations needed,The fight against malnutrition is a collaborative effort. Different government agencies have been working to eradicate this problem.,Since 2010, the Department of Education's ,School-Based Feeding Program, (SBFF) has been trying to fix the problem of lack of nutrients and hungry children in schools. However, budget constraints limit the coverage of this program.,In the Senate, meanwhile, nutrition has become a \"topic of interest\" recently due to the many bills filed aiming for good nutrition.,Some files have sought to address these budget issues. Senator Juan Edgardo \"Sonny\" Angara's ,Child Nutrition Act ,aims to institutionalize feeding programs in school so that funds are allocated appropriately.,He has also called for a Senate inquiry to tackle the \"unchanging\" patterns of malnutrition that burden Filipinos, especially children. He also urged several stakeholders from different sectors, including businesses and manufacturers, to determine what steps to take to address food insecurity. (READ: ,Angara calls for Senate inquiry vs food insecurity and malnutrition,),Meanwhile, Senator Grace Poe through her ,Sustansya Para sa Batang Pilipino, Act,, seeks to answer the problem by giving complete lunch meals to all public elementary students. Just like Angara's bill, this also aims to further enhance and institutionalize government feeding programs.,Senator Ralph Recto, on the other hand, urges the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) to ,tap a chunk of the budget of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, (4Ps) to feed school children.,Time will tell if these actions will further improve the true state of the nation's nutrition. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Ending hunger and malnutrition is part of the 17 Global Goals and an important issue #PHVote 2016 aspirants should tackle!

Yet the coalition did not hold at the local level, where the two parties ,fielded opposing candidates in several provinces,.,In 2010, Aquino and Villar competed for the presidency, with both sides accusing each other of resorting to black propaganda. A spokesman for Villar, Cayetano criticized Aquino at the height of the campaign, and coined the term \"Topak\" to allude to his alleged psychological incapacity. The LP cast doubt on Villar's claims that he came from a poor family.,After 2013, the LP and the NP continued their partnership at the Senate where both parties constitute the majority. LP campaign manager Senator Franklin ,Drilon was elected Senate President,, while Cayetano became majority leader.,\u2018What has Binay accomplished?\u2019,Asked if he will run for president or vice president, Cayetano said he needs more time to decide.

Those are the questions.\u201d ,The senator also said Binay should not have announced his presidential plans shortly after becoming vice president.,\u201cI don\u2019t think he should have announced on the first day after [winning] that he wants to run in 2016.

He cannot say, \u2018I\u2019ve done this in Makati\u2019 when he hasn\u2019t done it in the whole Philippines.\u201d,Cayetano said the same thing of Interior Secretary Manuel \u201cMar\u201d Roxas II, who is being eyed to be the LP\u2019s standard bearer in 2016. The LP president-on-leave, Roxas ran against Binay for the vice presidency in 2010 but lost.

A file photo taken in July 2011 shows Somali refugees fetching water during a period of drought when the United Nations declared a famine in several parts Somalia. File photo by Tony KARUMBA/AFP ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Philippines and 19 other countries highly vulnerable to global warming want the world to gun for a more ambitious climate change target, saying the present one still poses grave threats to human rights.,Currently, the world is struggling to keep the globe's temperature from rising by more than 2\u00b0C.,But the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of 20 mostly tropical countries, say the goal should be to keep temperature rise at 1.5\u00b0C, a more challenging goal.,Members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum:,The Philippines, the country that chairs the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), has sent the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) a letter calling for the change in target.,Sent last April 30, the letter came with, 3 independent reports, on the difference spelled by a 1.5\u00b0C target to a 2\u00b0C target in terms of global warming's effect on human rights. ,\"In order to compensate for the inadequacy of the current long-term goal of 2\u00b0C, the Conference of Parties would be well advised to strengthen that goal by the maximum feasible amount. On current scientific understanding this means adopting a 1.5\u00b0C (or below) goal,\" wrote Climate Change Commission Secretary Lucille Sering.,Inadequate target,Representing the rest of CVF, Sering argued that devastating impacts of climate change are already felt today when the globe has warmed by just 0.85\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. What more if it warms by 2\u00b0C?,Studies show that in such a world, \"even high degrees of adaptation would fail to reduce risk to low levels,\" added Sering. (READ:, Climate change boosts conflict risk, flood, hunger: UN,),Climate change is already being felt by many tropical, developing countries \u2013 many of which are members of the CVF.,The Philippines, for instance, was hit in 2013 by what many regard as the strongest storm to make landfall in history. ,Pacific island countries are also deemed the most in danger of sea level rise and increasingly stronger typhoons that form in the Pacific Ocean.,To give other countries the chance to respond to the CVF's call for the more challenging target, Sering requested the UNFCCC to organize a special session before countries gather at the much-awaited ,Paris climate conference, in December. ,In the Paris summit, countries are expected to forge a historic climate deal outlining the global plan to keep global warming at a manageable level.,Thirsty world,The reports presented by the CVF show that changing the climate target to 1.5\u00b0C from 2\u00b0C makes a huge difference on how much climate change will endanger human rights. ,One report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights described possible effects on basic rights like right to life, adequate food, health, water and sanitation, housing, and the rights of vulnerable sectors like women and children.,One right that will certainly be compromised by a world which has warmed by 2\u00b0C is the right to water and sanitation, according to the report. ,Quoting the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it said such a temperature increase would lead to a \"very high risk\" of reduced access to water for rural and urban poor communities from the year 2080 to 2100.,There will also be severe reduction in water resources for 14% of the global population. ,Livelihood, especially of the poor, will suffer greatly from a 2\u00b0C warming. The report says there is a high risk of deteriorating livelihoods in drylands because such warming may drive crop and livestock production to tipping points. This would adversely affect small-scale farmers and herders. ,A 2\u00b0C scenario would, in general, \"slow down economic growth and poverty reduction, further erode food security, and trigger new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger,\" concluded the report.,Labor, displacement,Another report by the Ruby Coast Research Centre focused on the difference between a 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C scenario in terms of labor productivity and the world economy.,It posits that a hotter world would mean less productive laborers \u2013 whether it be farmers, construction workers or corporate employees. Less productive workers would lead to lower economic output, eventually affecting the Gross Domestic Product of countries. ,The report found that such impacts would be most strongly felt in tropical countries where, already, the temperature is \"high enough to substantially limit outdoor and indoor work during hot periods.\",The study was only able to compare 1.3\u00b0C and 2.2\u00b0C, following data available from reports by the IPCC.,In the year 2055, when global temperature has risen by 1.3\u00b0C, workers in tropical countries who do light labor (service jobs) lose 0.96% of their work hours. When the temperature rises by 2\u00b0C in 2085, this figure will double to 2.04%. ,For those who do moderate work (industry jobs), the hours lost goes from 2.74% to 5.18% and in heavy work (agricultural workers), from 4.89% to 8.55% \u2013 both of which also show a doubling of lost work hours. ,It's possible that, in the coming years and in certain parts of the world, it will be impossible for workers to finish their work hours without air-conditioning systems. ,The study found that in the Philippines for instance, those who do heavy work in shade but without cooling systems in a 1.3\u00b0C scenario will lose 6.36% of their usual working hours. But in a 2.2\u00b0C scenario, this grows to almost double or 11.30%.,The report concluded that the difference in labor productivity between a 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C scenario would roughly amount to $2.4 trillion in economic losses. ,That's enough to pay the daily salary of 222 billion Metro Manila minimum wage earners.,The last report by the Nansen Initiative emphasized how any increase in temperature would mean more people forced to leave their homes.,More warming \"will increase the frequency and intensity of disasters and raise sea levels, putting coastal cities and urban housing at risk, and leading to more displacement with devastating consequences for communities,\" said Walter Kaelin, envoy of the chairmanship of the Nansen Initiative.,Such findings, he said, would have to be considered when assessing the current 2\u00b0C goal. ,\u2013 Rappler.com", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/92203-philippines-forum-climate-change", "title": "PH leads call for more ambitious climate change goal"},

Climate justice advocates call on developed countries to fulfill their targets for reducing carbon emissions. Photo by Pia Ranada/Rappler,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 One week into the 12-day United Nations climate change conference, environmentalists on Tuesday, November 19, condemned Australia, Japan, and Canada for undermining ambitious deals to drastically reduce carbon emissions.,\"This week our colleagues in the Philippines witnessed first-hand the devastation wrought by Super Typhoon Haiyan. There is no doubt that they are experiencing the effects of climate change right now,\" said Tasneem Essop, who heads the Worldwide Fund for Nature delegation to the climate change conference in Poland.,\"This makes the actions of Japan, Australia, and Canada at these talks all the more difficult to comprehend. There is a fundamental disconnect between the reality of climate change and the attitudes of these countries. They must be held to account to explain their actions.\u201d,The 3 developed countries have signified they will lower their target for reducing carbon emissions. This means they will emit more carbon than the amount they pledged under the, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change,.,The reduction of carbon emissions is necessary to curb global warming, which scientists say is responsible for more frequent droughts and heatwaves, higher sea level rise and stronger storms. The UN climate change conference in Warsaw, Poland, opened just as the Philippines and the world was beginning to see the extend of devastation brought about by Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), which has left more than 3,600 dead.

(READ: ,Japan scales back greenhouse gas emissions target: official,),This is because Japan is now more dependent on carbon-emitting energy sources like coal and other fossil fuels. Ever since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami wrecked the Fukushima nuclear power plant causing leaks of radioactive material, the country has ,reviewed its nuclear energy policy,.,If, before the catastrophe, Japan got 26 to 29% of its energy from nuclear power, today it is not using nuclear energy at all. None of its nuclear powerplants are operational. ,Delegates from developing countries were extremely disappointed by Japan's reneging, said Gerry Arances of the Philippine Movement for Climate Justice (PMCJ) who is in Warsaw for the talks.,More coal,Australia, meanwhile, also signaled it will lower its carbon emission targets. The country has started to repeal a measure that taxes polluters like coal-fired plants and uses the money on clean energy programs. Instead, the money for clean energy programs will be sourced from taxpayer funds, putting the burden on citizens.,Canada, which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2011, lauded Australia's decision to end its carbon tax and encouraged others to follow suit.,Australia and Canada follow the United States in being the biggest carbon emitters in the world.,Australia recently approved coal mines in Queensland that will emit 3.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide in 30 years. According to ,Guardian columnist Graham Readfearn,, what these mines will spew out is the equivalent of 6 years worth of greenhouse gases emitted by the entire United Kingdom.,CUT CO2 EMISSIONS NOW. Climate justice advocates say cutting carbon emissions is a matter of life and death for disaster-stricken countries like the Philippines. Photo by Andrew Robles,Australia also refused to send ministers to the talks and is being represented only by a climate change ambassador, stoking fears that its government is not serious about climate change policies.,Canada has the ,world's 3rd largest oil reserves in Alberta,. Known as the Alberta tar sands, it produces oil when its sands are boiled. But this process is energy-intensive and emits lots of carbon. Although the carbon emissions of other Canadian provinces have stabilized since 1990, Alberta's emissions were up by 41% last year.,Green Climate Fund,One of the most important issues being heatedly debated over in the Warsaw conference is the idea of climate finance.,\",Climate finance is the way resources can be provided for vulnerable countries like the Philippines so we can prevent disasters like this, so we are able to plan and implement measures to protect our people from the ravages of climate change. It also allows us to pursue sustainable development,\" explained chief negotiator for the Philippines Naderev Sa\u00f1o. ,The main mechanism for climate finance is the Green Climate Fund in which developed countries give financial assistance to developing countries for climate resiliency programs. Ideally, this includes technology transfer so that vulnerable countries can take advantage of things like renewable energy or technology that can help them withstand climate-related disasters like storms.,Unfortunately, \"this fund is empty for the 4th year in a row,\" Sa\u00f1o told Rappler CEO Maria Ressa during a ,Talk Thursday episode,.,\"What we want to see here in Warsaw is for countries to put money on the table, to put money where their mouths are.

AFP PHOTO/JANEK SKARZYNSKI,In 2009, developed countries like the US, Japan, Germany, Britain, and Norway pledged US$30 billion to fast-track climate finance. Most of it went to renewable energy and climate change mitigation projects. But according to ,Washington Post,, only $5 billion actually went to poor countries to prepare them for the storms, droughts, and heat waves resulting from climate change. (READ: ,Green groups to DOE: What happened to renewable energy?,),Such projects include the $1 billion Norway gave Brazil to curb deforestation. Japan loaned Egypt $338 million for wind power projects. But critics like Oxfam International have said most of the aid isn't new. They already existed and were merely \"repackaged\" for climate change pledge.,The developed countries also promised to increase aid up to $100 billion a year by 2020, but it looks unlikely the promise will be kept. Most of the countries have not announced any plans to shell out anything for 2014. ,Painful ironies,One of the most painful ironies of climate change is that countries least responsible for global warming are suffering the most from it. ,Typhoon-weary Philippines emits only 0.9 metric tons of carbon per capita while wealthy and powerful US emits 17.6 metric tons. (READ: ,US owes us climate debt\u2013PH environmentalists,),This irony is why developing countries are pushing another controversial issue in the Warsaw talks: a mechanism that obligates developed countries to compensate poor countries for loss and damage wrought by climate change.,\"It's a platform by which the Philippines and other vulnerable countries can address what we call the 3rd wave of climate change when countries are no longer able to adapt because the losses are just too overwhelming. We need a system to acknowledge these losses,\" said Sa\u00f1o.,But according to Philippine delegates to the talk, Australia has signified its refusal to recognize the idea of loss and damage. ,Developing countries fear this may set the tone for other rich countries.

The concave shape allows water to funnel and pile up as it approaches land., , ,A convex coastline allows water to go around the land form, thereby dispersing it. , , , , , , ,A straight coastline also allows water to disperse before hitting the shore., , , ,Slope of ocean floor,A steeply sloping ocean floor (ocean floor that drops quickly after the coastline) leads to lower storm surge because the depth of the ocean floor allows water to disperse before reaching land. ,A gently sloping ocean floor leads to higher storm surge because the water piling up is blocked by the ocean floor, and has nowhere to go but up.  ,Local features,The movement and height of a storm surge is also affected by the barriers and various waterways unique to every locality. Such features include seawalls, mangroves, estuaries, and inlets. , ,TOTAL WATER LEVEL,But storm surge is only one ingredient to the rise of total water level along the coast due to a storm. ,Here are the other factors:  ,Tides,The gravitational pull of the moon and sun causes water levels to rise along the coast on a daily basis. When a storm surge happens during high tide, the rise in water level is increased. This is particularly dangerous for areas where the difference between water levels during low tide and high tide is significant. ,       , , ,Waves,During a storm, strong winds cause waves to continually break onshore. Water brought by waves pile up as waves get larger and bring greater amounts of water with nowhere else to go, thus causing water level rise. , , , , , ,Freshwater input,Strong rainfall brought about by a storm can cause river waters to rise. When this water flows downriver and reaches the coast, it contributes to the water level rise there., , , , , ,HOW TO PREPARE FOR STORM SURGE,As much as possible, human populations should not live near coastlines. They should be moved farther inland, far from the reach of storm surge or sea level rise. The exact distance will depend on the characteristics of the coastline. Areas only a few meters above sea level are particularly vulnerable and will require greater distances for 'no build' zones.,An early warning system is also important for coastal communities. New technology allows scientists to predict storm surge days in advance. Local government officials should be vigilant for any news of approaching storms. ,They should communicate quickly and coordinate closely with the government bodies and weather agencies capable of predicting storm surges. Such bodies include ,PAGASA, and ,Project NOAH, under the Department of Science and Technology and independent group ,Weather Philippines,.,Community leaders should evacuate the entire community before the storm surge occurs. Evacuation centers should be located far from the coast and well above sea level. ,Seawalls and mangroves can only serve as a buffer to lessen the impact and damage of a storm surge. But seawalls can be breached by wind-driven water and mangroves can be inundated. ,\u2013 Rappler.com,Sources:,Lea Soria, Marine Science Institute of the University of the Philippines,Earth Observatory of Singapore,Comprehensive National Fisheries Industry Development Plan 2010,National Weather Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/52455-storm-surge-101-risk-how-to-prepare", "title": "Storm Surge 101: Are you at risk?

A village in Bangaga, Davao Oriental is left lifeless by Typhoon Pablo. Photo by John Javellana ,MANILA, Philippines \u2013 \u201cEven if it may not be achievable, 1.5\u00b0C is the right goal to have. It is what we should, as leaders, agree to in Paris.\u201d,These were among the sentiments voiced by Dr Saleemul Huq, a renowned Bangladeshi climate expert and lead author of UN-commissioned scientific climate change reports during a summit held in Manila, Philippines on Monday, November 9.,In strong language, he appealed to the, representatives of 20 of the most climate-vulnerable countries ,to continue pushing for the world to adopt a 1.5\u00b0C goal instead of the more accepted, and easier, 2\u00b0C target.,Huq, one of the lead authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports said that while aiming to keep warming below 2\u00b0C will significantly reduce the likelihood of threats like sea level rise, freak typhoons, and catastrophic drought, certain countries in the world ,will still suffer,.,\u201cWhile 2\u00b0C as a long-term goal is safe for many countries and many peoples, it is not safe for all countries and all peoples. And so if we want all countries and all peoples to be safe, we need a 1.5\u00b0C goal,\u201d he said.,MESSAGE TO THE VULNERABLE. Climate expert Dr Saleemul Huq says he strongly supports the call of vulnerable countries for a more difficult to achieve yet safer goal to combat climate change. Photo by Pia Ranada/Rappler ,The ,1.5\u00b0C target is the main advocacy, of the 20 countries composing the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF). These 20 developing countries from the Pacific, Africa, Mediterranean, South America, and Asia are already suffering the most from climate change.,'We cannot protect you',Huq warned that if the ,much-awaited UN climate change conference, sticks to the 2\u00b0C goal, the world would have failed these 20 vulnerable countries.,\u201cThe global leadership meeting in Paris that adopts a 2\u00b0C goal will knowingly be writing off many people and many of those people are from the countries represented here and saying to them we cannot protect you because it\u2019s too difficult for us to make the emission cuts that are necessary to protect you, the most vulnerable people on planet earth. That\u2019s a bad decision for world leaders to be making,\u201d he said.,Some rich countries from the G77+China bloc oppose the 1.5\u00b0C because it is much more difficult to achieve. It would require even larger carbon emission cuts which is perceived to slow down economic growth.,The current carbon emission cuts pledged to the UN are not even enough to keep warming to 2\u00b0C, according to various analyses of the submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. What more if the goal is to limit warming to just 1.5\u00b0C?,But Huq said this difficulty should not stop the world from adopting the \u201cmorally correct\u201d goal. (,IN PHOTOS: The faces of climate chang,e,),\u201cThe reason for pushing the 1.5\u00b0C goal is not whether it\u2019s feasible and possible \u2013 we know it\u2019s going to be difficult \u2013 but whether it is morally correct or not.\u201d,Safer 'guardrail',A ,review commissioned by the UN, concluded that a 1.5\u00b0C goal would be a safer \u201cguardrail\u201d especially against risk from ocean acidification and extreme weather events.,It also showed that the difference between 1.5 \u00b0C and 2\u00b0C of warming \u201cis significant for highly temperature-sensitive systems, such as the polar regions, high mountains and the tropics, as well as for some other regions, in particular low-lying coastal regions.\u201d,The more ambitious temperature ceiling would better safeguard food security in places like Africa where crop yields are at greater risk from climate disruption than in other places in the world.,Other key benefits if the world were to adopt the 1.5\u00b0C goal include the following, according to the study:,The cost,But there is a cost to this more ambitious aim.,Though the technologies required for the 1.5\u00b0C scenario are the same for 2\u00b0C, they \u201cneed to be deployed faster, and energy demand needs to be reduced earlier,\u201d reads the report released last June.,Some technologies and policies required for the 1.5\u00b0C pathway may also \u201cnegatively impact poverty reduction efforts.\u201d adds the review.,Despite these challenges, the 20 vulnerable, poor countries won\u2019t be starting from scratch, stressed Huq.,These countries already have their wealth of experience handling climate threats.,\u201cNot only are the vulnerable countries vulnerable, they are actually now leading in some areas compared to the rest of the world in terms of how to tackle the problem of climate change,\u201d he said.,He called on the countries to share their best practices with each other and the rest of the world.

As the world becomes warmer in the coming years, Philippine agriculture will face greater challenges.,Water ,\u201cWater stress,\u201d both in quality and quantity, results from decreased rainfall in certain parts of the country, DOST said. This causes problems not only in agriculture, but also in health and energy production (i.e., dams).,Meanwhile, other areas experience the opposite and endure intensified tropical cyclones \u2013 threatening agriculture, infrastructure, and human settlements. ,Such calamities can worsen food insecurity among families. It is also important to note that some of the country\u2019s top agricultural areas are found in vulnerable regions. ,It is thus important to strengthen disaster preparedness and response, both at the national and local levels.,The ADB noted that sea levels have increased by 1-3mm/year. Warmer ocean temperature threatens aquatic life, hence the livelihoods of fisher folks. Coastal communities are likewise put at more risk. ,More problems, ,FAO enumerated 3 factors that make a country more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change:,The Philippines, most especially farmers and fisher folks, seems to fit the category. Without proper intervention, agricultural yields may decrease, discouraging more people from getting into agricultural jobs. This, in turn, can threaten the country\u2019s food supply., Source: NSO,Source: World Bank,\u201cInsufficient food supply could further lead to more malnutrition, higher poverty levels, and possibly, heightened social unrest and conflict in certain areas in the country, and even among the indigenous tribes,\u201d DOST added.,The World Health Organization (WHO) also emphasized that climate change can worsen air and water pollution \u2013 bearing impacts on health.,\u201cClimate change is global, but its impact is personal,\u201d FAO said. ,What to do?,Agriculture, forestry, and land conversion cause one-third of the global GHG emissions. \u201cHowever, they can also contribute to climate change mitigation through reducing greenhouse gas emissions by changing agricultural practices,\u201d FAO explained.,Vargas advised farmers to be more aware and open to adapting new practices such as organic farming and using climate-resilient varities. They must learn to let go of kangaroo logging, ,dayami, burning, illegal charcoal making, among other wasteful and destructive practices.,He asked the government to improve the national irrigation system to lessen the financial burdens of farmers. He also said farmers should be empowered to enable them to provide their own production needs.,\"',Pag naging ,dependent, ang magsasaka sa ,traders, o kapitalista, ang magiging papel nila ay ,laborer, o ,producer, na lang. Sila ang naghihirap pero ang ang nakikinabang traders,\" ,Vargas said. (If farmers become dependent on traders or capitalists, they will become mere laborers or producers. They will be the ones who will work hard, while the traders benefit.),Republic Act 9729 or the ,Climate Change Act of 2009, \"mainstreams\" climate change in policy formulation., ,The Department of Agriculture integrates this in its programs to protect and optimize agricultural and fishery production. ,\"As an example, all irrigation canals are now being constructed with surface-lining to prevent further water wastage, as climate change impacts point to a water-constrained future for the Philippines,\" Sa\u00f1o explained. ,Climate change is part of today's and probably also tomorrow's threats to food security.

Using comedic terms provides a more socially acceptable way to express themselves.,So before we talk any more about it, let\u2019s normalize it a bit. Masturbation, or touching one\u2019s own genitals for pleasure, is something that babies do from the time they are in the womb. It\u2019s a natural and normal part of healthy sexual development.,According to a ,nationally representative US sample,, 94% of men admit to masturbating, as do 85% of women. But societal perspectives of masturbation still vary greatly, and there\u2019s even some stigma around engaging in the act.,Related to this stigma are the many myths about masturbation, myths so ridiculous it\u2019s a wonder anyone believes them.,They include: masturbation causes blindness and insanity; masturbation can make sexual organs fall off; and masturbation causes infertility.,In actual fact, masturbation has many health benefits.,Good for you,For women, masturbation can help prevent cervical infections and urinary tract infections through the process of \u201ctenting,\u201d or the opening of the cervix that occurs as part of the arousal process.,Tenting stretches the cervix, and thus the cervical mucous. This enables fluid circulation, allowing cervical fluids full of bacteria to be flushed out.,Masturbation can lower risk of type-2 diabetes (though this association may also be explained by greater overall health), reduce insomnia through hormonal and tension release, and increase pelvic floor strength through the contractions that happen during orgasm.,For men, masturbation helps reduce risk of ,prostate cancer,, probably by giving the prostate a chance to flush out potential cancer-causing agents.,Masturbation also improves ,immune, functioning by increasing cortisol levels, which can regulate immune functioning in small doses. It also reduces ,depression, by increasing the amount of endorphins in the bloodstream.,Masturbation can also indirectly prevent infertility by ,protecting people, from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can lead to infertility \u2013 you can\u2019t give yourself one of these infections!,There is one final benefit to masturbation: it\u2019s the most convenient method for maximising orgasms.,And there are plenty of additional benefits from orgasms generally, ,including, reduced stress, reduced blood pressure, increased self-esteem, and reduced pain.,Good for your partner too,From a sexual health point of view, masturbation is one of the safest sexual behaviors. There\u2019s no risk of pregnancy or transmission of sexually transmitted infections; there\u2019s no risk of disappointing a partner or of performance anxiety; and there\u2019s no emotional baggage.,And, only an arm\u2019s length away, is mutual masturbation. Mutual masturbation (two partners who are pleasuring themselves in the company of the other) is a great (and safe) activity to incorporate into other partnered sexual activities.,It can be especially good to begin to learn more about what your partner likes and to demonstrate to your partner what you like. Open communication with a partner will improve your sex life and relationship, but is also important for modeling communication skills for younger generations.,Talking about masturbation also has benefits. Promoting ,sex-positive views, in our own homes and in society, including around masturbation, allows us to teach young people healthy behaviors and attitudes without stigma and shame.,Parents and guardians who feel embarrassed or need extra guidance to do this should seek out sex-positive sources of information, like ,ones from respected universities,. \u2013 ,Rappler.com,This article first appeared on ,The Conversation,.,Spring Chenoa Cooper, is a Senior Lecturer, University of Sydney; ,Anthony Santella, is ,Lecturer of HIV, STIs and Sexual Health, University of Sydney.", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/bahasa/englishedition/118095-masturbation-health-benefits", "title": "Happy news!

Lorenzana earlier ,admitted, there was a lack of \"appreciation of intelligence.\", ,\"When this event was surfacing, the big picture was still forming... The ground commander was only starting to understand the full picture,\" said Padilla.,Among the things the military did not expect were the presence of, Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon in Marawi City, the number of terrorists positioned there, and their sniping capability, according to Bautista.,Because of Hapilon's surprise appearance, the military decided to conduct a raid to capture him. The raid prematurely triggered the terrorists' plan to take over Marawi City.
